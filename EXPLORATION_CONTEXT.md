# EXPLORATION_CONTEXT.md

## 1. ORIGINAL EXPLORATION CONTEXT

### Original Problem
**Comprehensive MCP Architecture Enhancement** to address:
- Workflow recommending other workflows
- Native automation levels in MCP
- Agent DSL capabilities 
- Workflow plugins architecture
- Context management as MCP feature

### Core Example
Development workflow encountering uncertainty ‚Üí "Do you have ideas on how to accomplish this task?" ‚Üí Points to exploration workflow or categorized workflows with confirmation and auto-start

### Complexity Classification: **Complex** ‚úÖ
**Reasoning:**
- Multi-faceted architectural problem spanning recommendations, DSL, plugins, context
- Severe constraints: MCP statelessness, no conversation access, limited processing
- Multiple conflicting design approaches requiring resolution
- High-stakes requirements: better code quality, less human intervention

### Re-triage Decision: **Maintained Complex**
- Clarifications revealed expanded scope (interceptors, size management)
- Additional architectural components identified
- Constraints create complexity rather than simplifying

### Parameters
- **Automation Level**: Medium
- **Time Constraint**: Flexible
- **Deep Analysis**: Requested

## 2. DOMAIN RESEARCH SUMMARY

### Key Findings

**MCP Architecture Constraints:**
- ‚úÖ Completely stateless - no conversation memory
- ‚úÖ Only sees what agents provide per request
- ‚úÖ Cannot access agentic system
- ‚úÖ Limited processing capabilities ("very limited smarts")

**Agent Behavior Patterns Identified:**
- Agents skim surface without explicit deep-dive instructions
- Tendency to hallucinate when lacking full context
- Need explicit file creation vs. chat output instructions
- Require guidance on existing patterns/rules/dependencies
- Need resumption instructions for workflow continuity

**Existing DSL Pattern Discovery:**
- `metaGuidance` in workflows defines reusable functions
- Example: `fun updateDecisionLog() = 'Update Decision Log...'`
- Successfully reduces repetition and creates consistent vocabulary
- Proven pattern ready for architectural enhancement

### Viable Options Identified

1. **Enhanced Metadata Response** - Enrich step responses with guidance
2. **DSL-Driven Guidance** - Extend existing DSL pattern systematically
3. **Step Decorator Pattern** - Wrap steps with guidance layers
4. **Workflow Inheritance** - Base workflows with common guidance
5. **Response Templates** - Structured templates with progressive disclosure
6. **Contextual Hints System** - Dynamic hints based on step type
7. **Agent Behavior Profiles** - Predefined guidance patterns
8. **Workflow Macros** - Reusable guidance snippets
9. **Plugin-Based Architecture** - Modular guidance enhancement

### Critical Trade-offs

**Statelessness vs. Guidance Quality**
- Must embed all context in each response
- Cannot learn from conversation history
- Size limits constrain guidance depth

**Extensibility vs. Simplicity**
- Plugin architecture offers flexibility but adds complexity
- DSL provides power but requires learning curve
- Balance needed for maintainability

## 3. CLARIFICATIONS AND DECISIONS

### Questions Asked & Answered

**Q: Plugin ecosystem maturity preference?**
- A: Keep all options open, not focusing on plugins exclusively

**Q: DSL implementation approach?**
- A: Considering DSL block in workflow schema

**Q: Guidance injection method?**
- A: Tool output interception or workflow step plugins/imports

**Q: Size management strategy?**
- A: Schema limits plus potential agent input interceptor

**Q: Learning capabilities?**
- A: Uncertain due to MCP limitations

### Key Decisions
- ‚úÖ No backward compatibility needed
- ‚úÖ Can update existing workflows
- ‚úÖ Solution for all workflow types (local/bundled/remote)
- ‚úÖ Address all agent problems equally
- ‚úÖ Build on existing DSL pattern
- ‚úÖ Frequent updates based on observed behavior
- ‚úÖ Complex but maintainable solution
- ‚úÖ Focus on better code quality, less human intervention

### Priority Weightings
1. **Agent Effectiveness** - Primary goal
2. **Extensibility** - User preference for adaptable architecture
3. **Maintainability** - Must handle frequent updates
4. **Performance** - Response time matters for agent flow
5. **Feasibility** - Must work within MCP constraints

## 4. CURRENT STATUS

### Research Completeness: **Saturated** ‚úÖ
- Core architectural patterns identified
- Constraints fully mapped
- Existing patterns analyzed
- User requirements clarified

### Option Space Coverage
- 9 distinct architectural approaches identified
- Range from simple metadata to complex plugins
- Trade-offs well understood
- Ready for solution generation

### Key Insights
1. **DSL is the Foundation** - Existing pattern works well
2. **Statelessness Drives Design** - All guidance in responses
3. **Agent Guidance is Multi-Point** - DSL, metadata, interception
4. **Size Limits Critical** - Must manage response payload
5. **Extensibility Essential** - Architecture must evolve

### Remaining Unknowns
- Optimal injection points for guidance
- Best plugin interface design
- Size limit management strategies
- Performance impact of enriched responses

## 6. HANDOFF INSTRUCTIONS

### Critical Context for Continuation
1. **DSL Pattern is Key** - Build upon existing `metaGuidance` approach
2. **Statelessness is Absolute** - No conversation memory possible
3. **Multi-Component Architecture** - DSL + Plugins + Interceptors
4. **Agent Problems are Systemic** - Need comprehensive guidance

### Next Phase Focus
- Generate 5 solutions spanning simple to comprehensive
- Evaluate against agent effectiveness primarily
- Consider extensibility and maintainability heavily
- Keep MCP constraints central to all designs

### Methodology to Continue
1. Use existing DSL pattern as foundation
2. Design for stateless response enrichment
3. Plan multi-point guidance injection
4. Balance comprehensiveness with maintainability
5. Ensure all workflow types supported equally

### Do Not Forget
- User has working DSL pattern to leverage
- No backward compatibility constraints
- MCP has "very limited smarts"
- Agents need explicit everything
- Size limits are real constraint
