# Phased Context-Aware Orchestration Platform Implementation Context

## Decision Log

### Key Files Analyzed

1. **packages/workrail/src/container.ts**
   - **File Range**: Lines 1-43
   - **Why Important**: Central dependency injection setup showing current architecture
   - **Key Insights**: Already uses DI pattern with AppContainer interface, making it easy to extend with new services
   - **Impact on Implementation**: Will add new orchestration services to this container

2. **packages/workrail/src/mcp-server.ts**
   - **File Range**: Lines 27-401 (tool definitions)
   - **Why Important**: Main entry point and MCP tool definitions
   - **Key Insights**: Current tools (workflow_list, workflow_get, workflow_next, workflow_validate) will be enhanced
   - **Impact on Implementation**: Need to extend these tools while maintaining backward compatibility

3. **packages/workrail/src/application/services/**
   - **Files**: workflow-service.ts, context-optimizer.ts, validation-engine.ts
   - **Why Important**: Current service layer that will be extended
   - **Key Insights**: Already has context optimization concepts, validation engine
   - **Impact on Implementation**: Build upon existing services rather than replacing

4. **packages/workrail/docs/implementation/02-architecture.md**
   - **File Range**: Lines 1-305
   - **Why Important**: Documents clean architecture principles and standards
   - **Key Insights**: Clear separation of Domain/Application/Infrastructure layers
   - **Impact on Implementation**: Must follow established patterns

5. **packages/workrail/docs/naming-conventions.md**
   - **File Range**: Lines 1-45
   - **Why Important**: Coding standards for the project
   - **Key Insights**: PascalCase for classes, camelCase for functions, snake_case for files
   - **Impact on Implementation**: Ensure all new code follows conventions

## Architecture Overview

The MCP WorkRail server follows clean architecture with clear layer separation:

- **Domain Layer** (`src/domain/`): Pure business logic and entities
- **Application Layer** (`src/application/`): Use cases and services
- **Infrastructure Layer** (`src/infrastructure/`): External integrations, storage, RPC

The system uses dependency injection via a central container (`container.ts`) and already has foundational services like WorkflowService, ValidationEngine, and ContextOptimizer. The MCP server exposes workflow tools through JSON-RPC.

### Key Areas for Orchestration Platform Implementation

1. **Application Services Extension**: Add new orchestration services (ContextManager, RecommendationEngine, CapabilityRegistry) to `src/application/services/`
2. **Enhanced Use Cases**: Create new use cases in `src/application/use-cases/` for enhanced workflow operations
3. **Tool Enhancement**: Extend existing MCP tools in `mcp-server.ts` with orchestration features
4. **Storage Layer**: May need to extend storage interfaces for context caching and capability persistence
5. **Container Integration**: Wire new services through the existing DI container

### Alignment with User Rules

- ✅ Uses dependency injection pattern (container.ts)
- ✅ Follows clean architecture (Domain/Application/Infrastructure)
- ✅ Uses proper naming conventions (PascalCase classes, camelCase functions)
- ✅ Has comprehensive test structure
- ✅ Extensible design allows for new features

### Conflicts/Considerations

- No major conflicts identified
- Need to ensure backward compatibility when extending tools
- Must maintain stateless architecture while adding context enrichment
