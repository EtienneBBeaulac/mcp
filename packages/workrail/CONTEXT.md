# Workrail Loop Implementation - Context Documentation

## 1. ORIGINAL TASK CONTEXT

### Task Description
- **Primary Goal**: Implement loop support in Workrail workflow system
- **Source Document**: Phase 5 Final Recommendation & Implementation Guidance
- **Approach**: Unified loop model supporting simple and complex iteration patterns
- **Timeline**: 8-week phased implementation roadmap

### Complexity Classification
- **Classification**: LARGE (confirmed after analysis)
- **Reasoning**: 
  - Fundamental architectural changes to workflow execution
  - Multi-system impact (schema, types, services, validation)
  - Backward compatibility requirements
  - Comprehensive testing needs
  - 8-week implementation timeline

### Automation Level
- **Selected**: MEDIUM
- **Implications**: Standard confirmations for key decisions, balanced autonomy

## 2. CODEBASE ANALYSIS SUMMARY

### Architecture Overview
- **Pattern**: Clean architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **Core Layers**:
  - `src/domain/`: Business entities and interfaces
  - `src/application/`: Use cases, services, validation
  - `src/infrastructure/`: RPC server, storage implementations
  - `src/mcp-server.ts`: MCP protocol integration

### Key Components for Loop Implementation
- **WorkflowService** (`src/application/services/workflow-service.ts`): Core execution logic
  - Method: `getNextStep()` - requires major refactoring for loops
  - Currently finds next uncompleted step with condition evaluation
- **Schema** (`spec/workflow.schema.json`): Workflow structure definition
  - Version: 0.0.1, needs bump to 0.1.0
  - Strict validation, no loop support currently
- **Types** (`src/types/workflow-types.ts`): TypeScript interfaces
  - `WorkflowStep` interface needs extension
  - No loop-specific properties
- **ConditionEvaluator** (`src/utils/condition-evaluator.ts`): 
  - Already supports complex logic needed for loops
  - Can be reused without modification
- **ValidationEngine** (`src/application/services/validation-engine.ts`):
  - Sophisticated multi-rule validation
  - Can be extended for loop validation

### Testing Infrastructure
- **Patterns**: Unit tests with mocks, integration with real RPC, performance benchmarks
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive existing test suite
- **Key Test Files**:
  - `tests/unit/workflow-service.test.ts`
  - `tests/integration/`
  - `tests/performance/`

### Critical Discoveries
- **Stateless Model**: No persistent state, relies on `completedSteps` array
- **Context Flow**: Flat context object, no nesting support
- **No Step References**: Steps cannot reference other steps currently
- **Storage Layer**: Multiple implementations (file, memory, git, remote)

## 3. CLARIFICATIONS AND DECISIONS

### Architectural Decisions Made

1. **Step Reference Resolution**
   - Decision: Loop-specific implementation only
   - Rationale: Avoid complexity of general-purpose references

2. **State Management**
   - Decision: Keep stateless model with validation
   - Implementation: Add context size monitoring, `_loopState` namespace
   - Limits: 256KB total, warning at 80%

3. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Decision: Schema versioning (v0.0.1 ‚Üí v0.1.0)
   - Support: Both versions for 6 months
   - Tool: `workrail migrate-workflow` command

4. **Loop Exit Strategy**
   - Decision: Graceful exit with warnings
   - Behavior: Continue workflow, add warnings to context
   - Philosophy: Maintains "liveness-first" approach

5. **Nested Loops**
   - Decision: Postpone to future release
   - Rationale: Reduce initial complexity significantly

6. **Performance Approach**
   - Decision: Work within current architecture
   - Limits: Max 10 steps in loop body, monitor performance

7. **Testing Strategy**
   - Decision: Full integration tests with benchmarks
   - Coverage: Unit, integration, performance, example workflows

## 4. SPECIFICATION SUMMARY

### Core Objectives
- Enable iterative workflow patterns (while, until, for, forEach)
- Maintain stateless architecture
- Ensure safety with iteration limits
- Provide backward compatibility

### Success Criteria
- ‚úì All loop types execute correctly
- ‚úì Context size validation (256KB limit, 80% warning)
- ‚úì Max iterations: default 100, max 1000
- ‚úì Performance: <10ms overhead per iteration (P95)
- ‚úì Migration tool functional
- ‚úì 95% test coverage

### Key Design Elements
```json
{
  "type": "loop",
  "loop": {
    "type": "while|until|for|forEach",
    "condition": {...},
    "maxIterations": 100,
    "iterationVar": "currentIteration"
  },
  "body": "step-id"
}
```

### Context Variables
- `_loopState.{loopId}.iteration`: Current iteration
- `_loopState.{loopId}.item`: Current item (forEach)
- User-defined via `iterationVar`, `itemVar`, `indexVar`

## 5. ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN SUMMARY

### High-Level Approach
- **Strategy**: Extend existing workflow execution model with new `loop` step type
- **Philosophy**: Minimal disruption, maximum compatibility
- **Reuse**: Leverages existing condition evaluator, maintains stateless model

### Key Components
- **New Components**:
  - `LoopStepResolver`: Handles loop-specific step reference resolution
  - `LoopExecutionContext`: Manages loop state and variable injection
- **Modified Components**:
  - `WorkflowService`: Enhanced getNextStep() for loop handling
  - `ValidationEngine`: Extended with loop-specific validation
  - Schema validators: Support for dual versions (0.0.1 and 0.1.0)

### Integration Points
- Storage layer: No changes required
- Condition evaluator: Used as-is for loop conditions
- Validation framework: Extended, not replaced
- RPC/MCP layer: No external API changes

### Design Decisions
- Loop-specific references (not general-purpose)
- State tracked in context (not persisted)
- Graceful degradation on limits
- No nested loops initially

## 6. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN OVERVIEW

### Goal & Success Criteria
- Enable 4 loop types: while, until, for, forEach
- Maintain 100% backward compatibility
- Performance overhead < 10ms per iteration
- Context size limit 256KB with 80% warning
- Test coverage > 95% for loop logic

### Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1** (Weeks 1-2): Foundation - Schema, types, context
- **Phase 2** (Weeks 3-4): Core - Resolver, while loops, validation
- **Phase 3** (Weeks 5-6): Full support - All loop types, integration
- **Phase 4** (Weeks 7-8): Polish - Migration tool, docs, examples

### Key Risks & Mitigation
- **Infinite loops**: Hard limits (1000 iterations max)
- **Context explosion**: Size monitoring with warnings
- **Migration failures**: Dual version support for 6 months
- **Performance**: Benchmarks at each phase

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests: >95% coverage for new code
- Integration tests: End-to-end loop execution
- Performance tests: Benchmark overhead
- Example workflows: Common patterns (polling, retry, batch)

## 7. DEVILS ADVOCATE REVIEW INSIGHTS

- State consistency during failures
- Edge cases (empty arrays, concurrent modifications)
- Alternative generator-based approach considered

### Review Outcome

  - Migration tool: 14 tests passing
  - Example workflows: All 4 validated successfully
- Issues identified and addressed:

  - All loop types (while, until, for, forEach) functioning
  - Migration tool operational
  - CLI integration successful
  - Performance optimizations effective

- Commit: da05cd1

### Key Design Decisions
- **Stateless Design**: Loop state is passed through context rather than stored in service
- **Loop Body Isolation**: Steps referenced as loop bodies are automatically skipped unless their loop is executing
- **Context Enhancement**: getNextStep returns enhanced context for proper state propagation
- **No Recursive Overload**: Simplified recursive calls to prevent infinite loops
- **Strict Validation**: Workflows are validated on every getNextStep call to ensure correctness
- **No Nested Loops**: Currently prevented to simplify implementation and avoid complexity

- "4-phase implementation plan ready to execute"
- "All files verified and dependencies confirmed"

### Critical Decisions Not to Forget
1. **NO nested loops** in initial implementation
2. **Maintain stateless model** - no persistent state storage
3. **Schema versioning** approach for compatibility
4. **Graceful degradation** for loop limits
5. **Loop-specific** step references only
6. **Context size limit**: 256KB with 80% warning
7. **Max iterations**: 1000 hard limit

### Next Steps
- Begin Phase 1 implementation: Schema evolution and type definitions
- Follow the 4-phase plan in `loop-implementation-plan.md`
- Create feature branch for loop implementation
- Start with TODO: phase-1-schema-evolution
