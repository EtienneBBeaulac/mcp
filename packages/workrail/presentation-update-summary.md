# Presentation Update Summary

## ✅ **MAIN PRESENTATION UPDATES**

### **Added: Meta Moment (+30 seconds)**
**Location**: After "The Insight" (5:30-6:30)

**The Script**:
```
"At first, I used my manual workflows to BUILD WorkRail. 
Copy-pasting instructions to the LLM to help me code faster.

[Small laugh, slight head shake]

But as soon as I had the first workflow working—the task 
development workflow—I switched.

I started using WorkRail... to make WorkRail better.

And it accelerated everything.

That's when I knew this was real."
```

**Why this is powerful**:
- ✅ Meta moment (using WorkRail to build WorkRail)
- ✅ Proves it works (immediate dogfooding)
- ✅ Validation moment ("That's when I knew this was real")
- ✅ Memorable

**New presentation length**: ~25 minutes with meta moment

**⭐⭐⭐ iOS Team Story** (+30s net)
- Replaces single teammate with whole iOS team story
- Higher stakes: "ready to give up on AI entirely"
- Shows your teaching role + transformation
- Most impactful addition available

**⭐⭐ The Gatekeeper Bug** (+30s)
- Real production bug WorkRail caught
- Nobody found it: not review, not QA, not users
- One workflow run → found and fixed
- Concrete proof

**⭐ The 5 Workflows Moment** (+35s)
- "Most I ran simultaneously? Five workflows."
- Computer froze (Android Studio memory leak, not WorkRail)
- Adds humor + shows limit
- "Fundamentally different" transformation

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDED STRATEGY**

### **Step 1: Record Core Presentation**
- Use main script with meta moment
- Should run ~23-25 minutes

### **Step 2: Time It**
- Identify gaps: "I need X more seconds before Y"

### **Step 3: Selectively Add from Content Bank**

**If you run 23:00 (need ~2 min):**
1. iOS Team Story (+30s)
2. The Gatekeeper Bug (+30s)
3. The 5 Workflows Moment (+35s)
4. Demo narration (+30s)

**If you run 24:00 (need ~1 min):**
1. iOS Team Story (+30s)
2. Demo narration (+30s)

**If you run 25:00:**
Don't add anything! You're perfect.

## 📝 **KEY INSIGHTS CAPTURED**

From your detailed answers, we now have rich content about:

✅ **Timeline**: April/May start → August rollout  
✅ **Development speed**: Used WorkRail to build WorkRail  
✅ **Team context**: iOS team ready to quit vs Android team adoption  
✅ **Adoption challenges**: Slow at first, presentations changed that  
✅ **Concrete examples**: Gatekeeper bug, 5 workflows, daily routine  
✅ **Surprises**: MR review not popular, computer freezing at 5 workflows  
✅ **Evolution**: Loops for iterations, branches for complexity, context management  
✅ **Broader vision**: Not just software engineering  
✅ **Technical challenges**: Staying stateless, agent-managed state
