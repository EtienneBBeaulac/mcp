## Backup Procedures

- Schedule regular backups of:
  - Database (Postgres, etc.)
  - Workflow definitions (JSON files)
  - Configuration files
- Store backups in secure, offsite locations
- Automate backups using scripts or managed services

### Example: Database Backup Script

```sh
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > ./backups/db-$(date +%F).sql
```

### Example: Workflow Backup Script

```sh
tar czf ./backups/workflows-$(date +%F).tar.gz ./workflows
```

---

## Restore Procedures

- Verify backup integrity before restoring
- Restore database using `psql` or cloud provider tools
- Restore workflow files to the correct directory
- Restart MCP server after restore

### Example: Database Restore

```sh
psql $DATABASE_URL < ./backups/db-YYYY-MM-DD.sql
```

### Example: Workflow Restore

```sh
tar xzf ./backups/workflows-YYYY-MM-DD.tar.gz -C ./workflows
```

## Disaster Recovery

- Maintain a runbook for major incidents
- Document RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective)
- Test failover to standby systems or cloud regions
- Communicate recovery status to stakeholders

---

## Testing Recovery

- Regularly test backup and restore procedures
- Simulate disaster scenarios in staging
- Document lessons learned and update procedures

---

## Best Practices

- Automate and monitor all backup jobs
- Encrypt backups at rest and in transit
- Store backups in multiple locations
- Document all recovery steps and keep this guide up to date
