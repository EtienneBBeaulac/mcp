## Threat Modeling

- Use STRIDE or similar frameworks to identify threats
- Document attack surfaces for each component
- Regularly review and update threat models

## Penetration Testing

- Schedule regular internal and external pen tests
- Use automated tools (OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite)
- Test for injection, XSS, privilege escalation, and DoS
- Document findings and remediation steps

## Advanced Authentication

- Support for OAuth2, SSO, and multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Rotate secrets and tokens regularly
- Use short-lived tokens and refresh mechanisms
- Enforce strong password policies

## Audit Logging

- Log all security-relevant events (auth, config changes, workflow edits)
- Use tamper-evident log storage (e.g., append-only, cloud logging)
- Regularly review logs for suspicious activity
- Retain logs per compliance requirements

## Secure Plugin Architecture

- Sandbox plugins and restrict permissions
- Validate and sign plugins before loading
- Monitor plugin behavior for anomalies
- Provide a plugin security review checklist

## Zero Trust Principles

- Authenticate and authorize every request
- Minimize implicit trust between components
- Use network segmentation and least privilege
- Monitor and alert on policy violations

## Supply Chain Security

- Pin dependencies and use trusted sources
- Scan for vulnerabilities (npm audit, Snyk)
- Review and sign third-party code
- Monitor for dependency updates and advisories

## Security Automation

- Integrate security checks into CI/CD
- Automate dependency scanning and secret detection
- Use infrastructure-as-code security tools (Checkov, tfsec)
- Automate incident response where possible
