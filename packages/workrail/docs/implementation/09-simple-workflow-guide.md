## Getting Started with Workflows

### What is a Workflow?

A workflow is a structured sequence of steps that guides an AI agent through a development task. Think of it as a recipe that helps the AI follow best practices and avoid common pitfalls.

### How to Read the Existing Example

Let's look at the authentication workflow example:

```json
{
  "id": "simple-auth-implementation",
  "name": "Simple Authentication Implementation",
  "description": "Implement basic JWT authentication for a REST API with user login and token validation",
  "preconditions": [
    "User model exists in the database",
    "JWT library is installed in the project",
    "Environment variables for JWT_SECRET are configured"
  ],
  "clarificationPrompts": [
    "What is the token expiration time you want to use?",
    "Should the authentication support refresh tokens?",
    "Do you need role-based access control?"
  ],
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "analyze-current-auth",
      "title": "Analyze current authentication setup",
      "prompt": "Examine the existing authentication implementation if any. Look for: user model structure, existing auth middleware, login endpoints. Document what you find.",
      "requireConfirmation": true
    }
  ],
  "metaGuidance": [
    "Always hash passwords using bcrypt or similar",
    "Include proper error messages for debugging",
    "Follow RESTful conventions for endpoints",
    "Add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks"
  ]
}
```

**Key Parts:**
- **`id`**: Unique identifier (use kebab-case)
- **`name`**: Human-friendly title
- **`description`**: What the workflow accomplishes
- **`preconditions`**: What must be true before starting
- **`clarificationPrompts`**: Questions to ask upfront
- **`steps`**: The actual workflow steps
- **`metaGuidance`**: Best practices that apply throughout

**Available in current release:**
- **`runCondition`**: Optional condition on steps for "choose your own adventure" workflows
- **`agentRole`**: Optional agent behavioral instructions (separate from user-facing prompts)

---

## Creating Your First Workflow

### Step 1: Start with a Template

Copy the authentication example and modify it for your needs:

```json
{
  "id": "your-workflow-id",
  "name": "Your Workflow Name",
  "description": "What your workflow accomplishes",
  "preconditions": [
    "Prerequisite 1",
    "Prerequisite 2"
  ],
  "clarificationPrompts": [
    "Question 1?",
    "Question 2?"
  ],
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "step-1",
      "title": "First Step",
      "prompt": "What to do in this step",
      "agentRole": "Optional: specific behavioral guidance for the AI agent",
      "requireConfirmation": true
    }
  ],
  "metaGuidance": [
    "Best practice 1",
    "Best practice 2"
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Define Your Steps

Each step should follow the **prep/implement/verify** pattern:

```json
{
  "id": "implement-feature",
  "title": "Implement the feature",
  "prompt": "**PREP**: First, understand the current state and requirements.\n\n**IMPLEMENT**: Make the necessary changes following the plan.\n\n**VERIFY**: Test your changes and ensure they work correctly.",
  "requireConfirmation": true
}
```

### Step 3: Add Clarification Prompts

Ask questions that help clarify requirements:

```json
"clarificationPrompts": [
  "What is the main goal of this feature?",
  "Are there any specific constraints or requirements?",
  "Which files are most likely to be affected?"
]
```

---

## Workflow Design Basics

### The prep/implement/verify Pattern

This pattern helps ensure quality by breaking each step into three phases:

1. **PREP**: Understand the current state and requirements
2. **IMPLEMENT**: Make focused, specific changes
3. **VERIFY**: Test and validate the changes

**Example:**
```json
{
  "id": "add-user-validation",
  "title": "Add user input validation",
  "prompt": "**PREP**: Examine the current user input handling and identify validation gaps.\n\n**IMPLEMENT**: Add appropriate validation rules for user inputs.\n\n**VERIFY**: Test with various input scenarios to ensure validation works correctly.",
  "requireConfirmation": true
}
```

### When to Use `requireConfirmation`

Use `requireConfirmation: true` when:
- The step makes significant changes
- User approval is needed before proceeding
- The step involves important decisions
- You want to pause for review

**Example:**
```json
{
  "id": "create-database-migration",
  "title": "Create database migration",
  "prompt": "Create a database migration for the new user fields.",
  "requireConfirmation": true
}
```

### When to Use `askForFiles`

Use `askForFiles: true` when:
- The step needs to examine specific files
- File context is important for the step
- You want to ensure the agent has the right files

**Example:**
```json
{
  "id": "review-existing-code",
  "title": "Review existing implementation",
  "prompt": "Examine the current implementation and identify areas for improvement.",
  "askForFiles": true
}
```

### When to Use `runCondition`

Use `runCondition` when:
- Different steps should execute based on task scope or complexity
- You want "choose your own adventure" style workflows
- Steps should be skipped based on user expertise or preferences
- Conditional logic is needed for different scenarios

**Example:**
```json
{
  "id": "advanced-optimization",
  "title": "Advanced performance optimization",
  "prompt": "Implement advanced caching and optimization strategies.",
  "runCondition": {
    "and": [
      {"var": "taskScope", "equals": "large"},
      {"var": "userExpertise", "equals": "expert"}
    ]
  }
}
```

**Supported condition operators:**
- `equals`, `not_equals`: Value comparison
- `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`: Numeric comparison
- `and`, `or`, `not`: Logical operations

### When to Use `agentRole`

Use `agentRole` when:
- You want to provide specific behavioral guidance to the AI agent
- The agent needs role-specific expertise (security expert, code reviewer, etc.)
- You want to separate agent instructions from user-facing content
- Different steps require different agent personas or expertise

**Example:**
```json
{
  "id": "security-review",
  "title": "Security Code Review",
  "prompt": "Please review the provided code for security issues.",
  "agentRole": "You are a cybersecurity expert specializing in code security. Focus on identifying vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypasses, and data exposure. Provide specific remediation steps for any issues found.",
  "askForFiles": true
}
```

**Best Practices for agentRole:**
- Be specific about the agent's expertise and focus areas
- Include what the agent should look for or prioritize
- Mention the expected output format or approach
- Keep it separate from user-facing instructions in the prompt

### Writing Good Prompts

**Good Prompt:**
```json
{
  "prompt": "**PREP**: Analyze the current authentication system and identify security gaps.\n\n**IMPLEMENT**: Add input validation and sanitization to prevent common attacks.\n\n**VERIFY**: Test with malicious inputs to ensure security measures work."
}
```

**Bad Prompt:**
```json
{
  "prompt": "Fix the authentication system"
}
```

**Why the first is better:**
- Clear structure with prep/implement/verify
- Specific instructions
- Includes validation criteria
- Follows the pattern consistently

### Function Reference Pattern (Advanced)

For complex workflows with repeated instructions, you can use a **function reference pattern** to reduce duplication and improve maintainability. This creates a pseudo-DSL (Domain Specific Language) within your workflow.

#### How It Works

Define reusable "functions" in your `metaGuidance` section, then reference them throughout your workflow:

**Example Function Definitions:**
```json
{
  "metaGuidance": [
    "fun updateDecisionLog() = 'Update Decision Log in CONTEXT.md: file paths/ranges, excerpts, why important, outcome impact. Limit 3-5 files/decision.'",
    "fun useTools() = 'Use tools to verify‚Äînever guess. Expand file reads to imports/models/interfaces/classes/deps. Trace all dependencies.'",
    "fun createFile(filename) = 'Use edit_file to create/update {filename}. NEVER output full content in chat‚Äîonly summarize. If fails, request user help & log command.'",
    "fun applyUserRules() = 'Apply & reference user-defined rules, patterns & preferences. Document alignment in Decision Log. Explain rule influence in decisions.'",
    "fun matchPatterns() = 'Use codebase_search/grep to find similar patterns. Reference Decision Log patterns. Match target area unless user rules override.'",
    "fun gitCommit(type, msg) = 'If git available: commit with {type}: {msg}. If unavailable: log in CONTEXT.md with timestamp.'",
    "When you see function calls like updateDecisionLog() or createFile(spec.md), refer to the function definitions above for full instructions."
  ]
}
```

**Example Usage in Steps:**
```json
{
  "id": "create-specification",
  "title": "Create Technical Specification",
  "prompt": "Create a detailed technical specification from the analysis.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Include existing patterns/conventions from analysis\n- System integration approach\n- applyUserRules() throughout\n- matchPatterns() from codebase\n\n**Actions:**\n- createFile(spec.md)\n- updateDecisionLog()\n- Sanity check complexity level"
}
```

#### Benefits of Function References

1. **Significant deduplication**: Each instruction appears only once
2. **Improved consistency**: Same wording used everywhere  
3. **Better readability**: Prompts become more scannable
4. **Easier maintenance**: Update function definition once, applies everywhere
5. **Context savings**: Reduces file size by 15-20% while maintaining detail

#### Implementation Tips

- **Function Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names like `updateDecisionLog()` or `createFile(filename)`
- **Parameter Support**: Simple parameter substitution works: `createFile(spec.md)` becomes instructions for "spec.md"
- **Resumption Support**: Include function definitions in CONTEXT.md for workflow resumption
- **Documentation**: Always include the interpretation instruction in metaGuidance

#### When to Use This Pattern

‚úÖ **Good for:**
- Complex workflows with repeated instructions
- Workflows with >10 steps that share common patterns
- Team workflows where consistency is crucial
- Workflows that need detailed instructions but have character limits

‚ùå **Avoid for:**
- Simple workflows with few steps
- One-off workflows that won't be maintained
- Workflows where explicit instructions are clearer

#### Character Limits and Validation

Remember that metaGuidance items have a 256-character limit in the schema. Keep function definitions concise:

```json
// ‚úÖ Good - under 256 characters
"fun updateDecisionLog() = 'Update Decision Log: file paths, why important, outcome impact. Limit 3-5 files.'"

// ‚ùå Too long - over 256 characters
"fun updateDecisionLog() = 'Update the Decision Log section in CONTEXT.md with detailed file paths and line ranges, excerpts showing why each file was important, and how they influenced the outcome and decision-making process throughout the workflow execution. Always limit to the top 3-5 most impactful files per decision for scannability and conciseness.'"
```

## Testing Your Workflow

### Step 1: Validate Against Schema

#### CLI Validation
Use the JSON schema to validate your workflow:

```bash
# Example validation (when tools are available)
npm run validate-workflow your-workflow.json
```

#### MCP Tool Validation
You can also validate workflow JSON directly through the MCP protocol:

```bash
# Example: Validate workflow JSON via MCP tool
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"workflow_validate_json","arguments":{"workflowJson":"{\"id\":\"my-workflow\",\"name\":\"My Workflow\",\"description\":\"A test workflow\",\"steps\":[{\"id\":\"step1\",\"title\":\"First Step\",\"prompt\":\"Do something\"}]}"}}}' | node dist/mcp-server.js
```

**When to use `workflow_validate_json`:**
- Building workflow editors or management tools
- Integrating validation into automated workflows
- Providing real-time validation feedback
- Validating programmatically generated workflows

**Benefits:**
- Comprehensive JSON syntax validation
- Schema compliance checking
- Actionable error messages with suggestions
- No external dependencies required

### Step 2: Basic Testing Checklist

- [ ] Does the workflow have a unique `id`?
- [ ] Is the `name` clear and descriptive?
- [ ] Does the `description` explain what it accomplishes?
- [ ] Are all required fields present?
- [ ] Do the steps follow the prep/implement/verify pattern?
- [ ] Are clarification prompts clear and relevant?
- [ ] Is metaGuidance helpful and specific?

### Step 3: Advanced Step Output Validation

The workflow system includes a powerful **ValidationEngine** that can validate step outputs using three enhancement types:

#### JSON Schema Validation
Validate structured output against a JSON schema:

```json
{
  "id": "create-user-api",
  "title": "Create user API endpoint",
  "prompt": "**PREP**: Design the API endpoint structure.\n\n**IMPLEMENT**: Create the endpoint with proper validation.\n\n**VERIFY**: Test the endpoint with various inputs.",
  "validationCriteria": [
    {
      "type": "schema",
      "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "endpoint": {"type": "string", "pattern": "^/api/users(/.*)?$"},
          "method": {"type": "string", "enum": ["POST", "PUT", "PATCH"]},
          "validation": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "required": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}},
              "properties": {"type": "object"}
            },
            "required": ["required", "properties"]
          }
        },
        "required": ["endpoint", "method", "validation"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Context-Aware Validation
Apply validation rules conditionally based on context:

```json
{
  "id": "database-migration",
  "title": "Create database migration",
  "prompt": "**PREP**: Analyze the database changes needed.\n\n**IMPLEMENT**: Create migration files.\n\n**VERIFY**: Test migration in development environment.",
  "validationCriteria": [
    {
      "type": "contains",
      "value": "CREATE TABLE",
      "condition": "context.migrationType === 'create'"
    },
    {
      "type": "contains", 
      "value": "ALTER TABLE",
      "condition": "context.migrationType === 'modify'"
    },
    {
      "type": "regex",
      "pattern": "rollback|down|revert",
      "condition": "context.requiresRollback === true"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Logical Composition Validation
Combine multiple validation rules with logical operators:

```json
{
  "id": "security-implementation",
  "title": "Implement security measures",
  "prompt": "**PREP**: Identify security requirements.\n\n**IMPLEMENT**: Add authentication and authorization.\n\n**VERIFY**: Test security measures thoroughly.",
  "validationCriteria": {
    "and": [
      {
        "or": [
          {"type": "contains", "value": "jwt"},
          {"type": "contains", "value": "session"}
        ]
      },
      {
        "type": "regex",
        "pattern": "\\b(authorize|permission|role)\\b"
      },
      {
        "not": {
          "type": "contains",
          "value": "password"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Common Validation Errors

**Missing Required Fields:**
```json
// ‚ùå Missing required fields
{
  "name": "My Workflow"
  // Missing id, description, steps
}
```

**Invalid Step Structure:**
```json
// ‚ùå Invalid step
{
  "id": "step-1",
  "title": "My Step"
  // Missing required 'prompt' field
}
```

**Invalid ID Format:**
```json
// ‚ùå Invalid ID (contains spaces)
{
  "id": "my workflow",
  // Should be: "my-workflow"
}
```

**Invalid Validation Criteria:**
```json
// ‚ùå Invalid schema format
{
  "type": "schema",
  "schema": "not a valid schema object"
}

// ‚ùå Invalid condition syntax
{
  "type": "contains",
  "value": "test",
  "condition": "invalid javascript syntax"
}

// ‚ùå Missing logical operator
{
  "validationCriteria": {
    "invalidOperator": [
      {"type": "contains", "value": "test"}
    ]
  }
}
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. **Vague Prompts**
```json
// ‚ùå Too vague
{
  "prompt": "Fix the bug"
}

// ‚úÖ Specific and structured
{
  "prompt": "**PREP**: Identify the root cause of the authentication bug.\n\n**IMPLEMENT**: Apply the fix with proper error handling.\n\n**VERIFY**: Test the fix with various scenarios."
}
```

### 2. **Missing Preconditions**
```json
// ‚ùå No preconditions
{
  "steps": [...]
}

// ‚úÖ Clear preconditions
{
  "preconditions": [
    "Database is accessible",
    "Required libraries are installed",
    "Environment variables are configured"
  ]
}
```

### 3. **Poor Step Organization**
```json
// ‚ùå Steps not logically ordered
{
  "steps": [
    {"id": "test", "title": "Test the feature"},
    {"id": "implement", "title": "Implement the feature"},
    {"id": "plan", "title": "Plan the implementation"}
  ]
}

// ‚úÖ Logical order
{
  "steps": [
    {"id": "plan", "title": "Plan the implementation"},
    {"id": "implement", "title": "Implement the feature"},
    {"id": "test", "title": "Test the feature"}
  ]
}
```

### 4. **Inconsistent Patterns**
```json
// ‚ùå Inconsistent pattern usage
{
  "steps": [
    {"id": "step1", "prompt": "PREP: Analyze... IMPLEMENT: Code... VERIFY: Test..."},
    {"id": "step2", "prompt": "Just do this thing"}
  ]
}

// ‚úÖ Consistent pattern usage
{
  "steps": [
    {"id": "step1", "prompt": "PREP: Analyze... IMPLEMENT: Code... VERIFY: Test..."},
    {"id": "step2", "prompt": "PREP: Review... IMPLEMENT: Update... VERIFY: Validate..."}
  ]
}
```

  ]
}
```

## Enhanced Example Workflows

The following example workflows in `spec/examples/` now demonstrate agentRole best practices:

### 1. Simple Authentication Implementation (`valid-workflow.json`)

This example showcases how to use agentRole for different security-focused roles:

- **Security-focused systems analyst** for authentication assessment
- **Senior backend engineer** for secure middleware development  
- **API development specialist** for authentication endpoints
- **Quality assurance engineer** for security testing

Each step demonstrates how agentRole provides specialized behavioral guidance while keeping user-facing prompts clear and focused.

### 2. Adaptive Development Workflow (`conditional-workflow-example.json`)

This advanced example demonstrates agentRole usage with conditional logic:

- **Project setup specialist** for environment configuration
- **Senior business analyst** for complex requirement analysis (large/complex tasks only)
- **Efficient developer** for simple implementations
- **Patient mentor** for novice users
- **Senior software engineer** for expert implementations
- **Performance engineering specialist** for optimization (complex tasks only)

The agentRole fields automatically adapt based on:
- User expertise level (`novice`, `intermediate`, `expert`)
- Task scope (`small`, `medium`, `large`) 
- Task complexity (0.1 to 1.0 scale)

### AgentRole Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Role Specificity**: Each agentRole provides specific expertise and behavioral guidance
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Agent instructions are separate from user-facing prompts
3. **Conditional Adaptation**: Agent roles can change based on workflow conditions
4. **Professional Personas**: Each role represents a realistic professional with specific expertise
5. **Behavioral Guidance**: Roles guide approach, methodology, and focus areas

## Next Steps

1. **Practice**: Create a simple workflow for a task you're familiar with
2. **Validate**: Use the schema to validate your workflow
3. **Test**: Try using your workflow with an AI agent
4. **Improve**: Refine your workflow based on feedback
5. **Share**: Contribute your workflow to the community
