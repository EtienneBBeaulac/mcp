# Migration Guide: v0.0.1 to v0.1.0

This guide helps you migrate your workflows from Workrail v0.0.1 to v0.1.0, which introduces loop support and schema versioning.

## What's New in v0.1.0

### Major Features
- **Loop Support**: Four types of loops (while, until, for, forEach)
- **Schema Versioning**: Explicit version field for workflows
- **Migration Tool**: Automated migration command

### Breaking Changes
None - v0.1.0 is fully backward compatible with v0.0.1 workflows.

## Automatic Migration

The easiest way to migrate is using the CLI tool:

```bash
# Migrate a single workflow
workrail migrate my-workflow.json

# Preview changes without modifying files
workrail migrate my-workflow.json --dry-run

# Create a backup of the original
workrail migrate my-workflow.json --backup

# Save to a different file
workrail migrate my-workflow.json --output my-workflow-v0.1.0.json
```

## Manual Migration

If you prefer to migrate manually:

### 1. Add Version Field

Add the `version` field to your workflow:

```json
{
  "id": "my-workflow",
  "name": "My Workflow",
  "description": "Does something useful",
  "version": "0.1.0",  // Add this line
  "steps": [...]
}
```

### 2. Identify Loop Patterns

Look for repetitive steps that could be replaced with loops:

#### Before (v0.0.1):
```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "check-status-1",
      "title": "Check Status (Attempt 1)",
      "prompt": "Check if the operation is complete"
    },
    {
      "id": "check-status-2", 
      "title": "Check Status (Attempt 2)",
      "prompt": "Check if the operation is complete"
    },
    {
      "id": "check-status-3",
      "title": "Check Status (Attempt 3)",
      "prompt": "Check if the operation is complete"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### After (v0.1.0):
```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "check-status-loop",
      "type": "loop",
      "title": "Check Status Until Complete",
      "loop": {
        "type": "for",
        "count": 3,
        "maxIterations": 3,
        "iterationVar": "attempt"
      },
      "body": "check-status"
    },
    {
      "id": "check-status",
      "title": "Check Status",
      "prompt": "Check if the operation is complete (Attempt {{attempt}})"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Common Patterns to Migrate

### Polling Pattern
Look for: Multiple steps checking status repeatedly  
Replace with: `while` loop with condition

### Retry Pattern  
Look for: Duplicate steps with "retry" or "attempt" in the name  
Replace with: `for` loop with fixed count

### Batch Processing
Look for: Steps like "Process item 1", "Process item 2", etc.  
Replace with: `forEach` loop over items

### Search Pattern
Look for: Sequential checks across multiple sources  
Replace with: `until` loop with found condition

## Validation

After migration, validate your workflows:

```bash
workrail validate my-workflow.json
```

## Getting Help

- See [Loop Documentation](../features/loops.md) for detailed loop syntax
- Check [examples](../../workflows/examples/loops/) for working loop patterns
- Run `workrail migrate --help` for CLI options

## FAQ

**Q: Do I have to migrate to v0.1.0?**  
A: No, v0.0.1 workflows continue to work. Migration is optional but recommended for new features.

**Q: Can I mix v0.0.1 and v0.1.0 workflows?**  
A: Yes, Workrail handles both versions transparently.

**Q: What if migration fails?**  
A: The tool validates workflows before saving. Use `--dry-run` to preview changes safely.

**Q: How do I know which version my workflow uses?**  
A: Check for the `version` field. If missing, it's v0.0.1. The migrate tool also reports versions.
