I need you to test the Workrail bug investigation workflow.

Read the file: /Users/etienneb/git/personal/mcp/packages/workrail/AGENT_TEST_INSTRUCTIONS.md

Follow ALL instructions in that file carefully. This is a complete end-to-end test of:
1. The systematic bug investigation workflow
2. Session management with real-time dashboard
3. Progress tracking through 6 phases
4. Hypothesis generation and validation
5. Root cause identification

The test scenario is bug "DASH-001" - a dashboard data staleness issue.

Execute the workflow step-by-step, making ALL required session updates as documented.

Report back on:
- Whether the dashboard updated in real-time
- Any issues encountered
- Final confidence score achieved
- Overall test results
