# Agent Role Implementation Summary

## Overview

The `agentRole` field has been successfully implemented in the workflow orchestration system to address the "guiding vs. doing" problem. This feature provides clean separation between agent behavioral instructions and user-facing content.

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### Completed Phases

#### Phase A: Schema Foundation
- **A1**: ✅ JSON Schema updated (`spec/workflow.schema.json`)
- **A2**: ✅ TypeScript types updated (`src/types/`)

#### Phase B: Validation System
- **B1**: ✅ Zod validation schemas updated (`src/validation/`)

#### Phase C: Processing Logic
- **C1**: ✅ WorkflowService updated to handle agentRole processing

#### Phase D: Testing & Documentation
- **D1**: ✅ Comprehensive test suite (10/10 tests passing)
- **D2**: ✅ Example workflow and documentation

## Key Benefits

### 1. Clean Separation of Concerns
- **`prompt`**: User-facing content for humans to read
- **`agentRole`**: Agent behavioral instructions (hidden from users)

### 2. Improved AI Reliability
- Eliminates confusion from mixed instructions
- Provides focused behavioral guidance
- Maintains clear user communication

### 3. Backward Compatibility
- All existing workflows continue to work unchanged
- Optional field with graceful degradation
- No breaking changes to API

## Technical Implementation

### Schema Changes
```json
{
  "agentRole": {
    "type": "string",
    "minLength": 10,
    "maxLength": 1024,
    "description": "Agent behavioral instructions (hidden from users)"
  }
}
```

### Processing Logic
When a step has an `agentRole`, the system:
1. Prepends agent instructions to the guidance prompt
2. Maintains the user-facing prompt unchanged
3. Handles empty agentRole gracefully (no header added)

### Example Output Structure
```
## Agent Role Instructions
You are an expert code reviewer. Focus on security and best practices.

## Step Guidance
- Review for common vulnerabilities
- Check authentication logic

Please provide the code you'd like reviewed.
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```json
{
  "id": "step-with-agent-role",
  "title": "Code Review",
  "prompt": "Please provide your code for review.",
  "agentRole": "You are an expert security auditor. Focus on identifying vulnerabilities and providing actionable remediation steps."
}
```

### With Guidance
```json
{
  "id": "comprehensive-step",
  "title": "Security Analysis",
  "prompt": "Analyze the provided code for security issues.",
  "agentRole": "You are a cybersecurity expert. Look for SQL injection, XSS, and authentication bypasses.",
  "guidance": [
    "Check input validation",
    "Review authentication logic",
    "Examine data handling"
  ]
}
```

## Validation Rules

- **Optional**: Field is not required
- **Length**: 10-1024 characters when present
- **Type**: String
- **Empty strings**: Handled gracefully (no processing)

## Test Coverage

### Comprehensive Test Suite (10/10 passing)
1. ✅ AgentRole with guidance combination
2. ✅ AgentRole without guidance
3. ✅ Steps without agentRole (backward compatibility)
4. ✅ Empty agentRole handling
5. ✅ Proper prompt construction
6. ✅ Step processing flow
7. ✅ Workflow progression
8. ✅ Completion handling
9. ✅ Error scenarios
10. ✅ Integration scenarios

## Example Workflow

See `workflows/example-agent-role-workflow.json` for a complete practical example demonstrating:
- Code review workflow with specialized agent roles
- Security expert, performance specialist, and architect personas
- Clear separation of user prompts and agent instructions
- Progressive workflow with different expertise at each step

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Workflows
No changes required - all existing workflows continue to work unchanged.

### For New Workflows
Add `agentRole` to steps where you want to provide specific behavioral guidance:

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "my-step",
      "title": "My Step",
      "prompt": "User-facing instruction",
      "agentRole": "Agent behavioral guidance"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Performance Impact

- ✅ No performance degradation
- ✅ Minimal memory overhead
- ✅ Same API response times
- ✅ Efficient string processing

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
1. **Role Templates**: Pre-defined agent roles (e.g., "security-expert", "code-reviewer")
2. **Role Inheritance**: Steps inheriting roles from workflow-level defaults
3. **Dynamic Roles**: Context-aware role selection based on step conditions
4. **Role Validation**: Semantic validation of role descriptions

## Conclusion

The `agentRole` implementation successfully addresses the original problem while maintaining full backward compatibility. The feature provides clear separation between user-facing content and agent behavioral instructions, leading to more reliable and focused AI interactions within workflow contexts.
