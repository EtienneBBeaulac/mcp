# Workflow Orchestration System Overview

## 1. Introduction & Vision

### What This Is All About

The Workflow Orchestration System is an opinionated framework designed to guide Large Language
Models (LLMs) through complex software development tasks with improved reliability and consistency.
Rather than hoping an LLM will follow best practices, this system *guides them toward* best
practices through structured, machine-readable workflows.

At its core, this is about improving the way developers collaborate with AI. Instead of open-ended
prompting that often leads to hallucinations, scope creep, and inconsistent results, we provide a
rails-based approach where both the human developer and the AI agent follow a proven, step-by-step
process.

### The Core Problem It Solves

LLMs are incredibly powerful but suffer from well-documented limitations:

- **Hallucination**: They confidently generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information
- **Scope Creep**: Given a complex task, they often try to do too much at once, leading to half-baked solutions
- **Context Loss**: They struggle to maintain focus across long conversations
- **Inconsistency**: The same prompt can yield wildly different results based on minor variations
- **Missing Prerequisites**: They often start implementing before gathering necessary context

Traditional approaches try to solve these through better prompting or more powerful models. We take
a different approach: we guide LLMs through proven software engineering best practices via
structured workflows, making it much more difficult for the LLM to go off track.

### The Vision

Our vision is to create an enhanced agent experience where:

1. **Developers** are guided through optimal workflows, missing fewer critical steps or context
2. **LLMs** are more likely to work within their strengths, following proven patterns
3. **Organizations** can achieve more consistent, higher-quality results regardless of individual
   prompt engineering skills
4. **Knowledge** from expert practitioners is codified and made more accessible

The end result is not just an AI coding assistant, but a sophisticated development methodology
guided through technology. It's the difference between giving someone a powerful tool versus
giving them a powerful tool *and* teaching them the craft of using it effectively.

## 2. System Architecture & Rationale

### How It's Structured and Why

The system follows a deliberately modular, microservices-inspired architecture.

This isn't complexity for complexity's sake—each architectural decision directly addresses the
limitations of monolithic AI agent designs while maintaining compatibility with any MCP-enabled
agent framework.

(MCP, or Model Context Protocol, is a lightweight open standard for local tool integration between
LLM agents and auxiliary servers.)

```
┌─────────────┐
│    User     │
└──────┬──────┘
       │
┌──────▼────────────────────────────────────┐

     │ • Validate      │
     └─────────────────┘ 
```

*Note: Firebender is an example of an MCP-compatible agent framework, alongside Claude Desktop, VS
Code, and others.*

### Component Breakdown

#### workflowlookup Server
**Single Responsibility**: Workflow storage, retrieval, and orchestration guidance

This MCP server is the heart of the system, providing intelligent workflow guidance:
- **What it does**:
    - Stores and retrieves workflow definitions
    - Provides step-by-step guidance to agents
    - Validates step completion
    - Suggests next actions based on workflow state
- **What it doesn't do**:
    - Force execution order (agents maintain autonomy)
    - Manage conversation state
    - Make decisions requiring user interaction
- **Why an MCP server**:
    - Works with any MCP-compatible agent
    - No agent framework modifications required
    - Simple to deploy and maintain

#### The Orchestration Pattern (Not a Component)
**The Innovation**: Orchestration through guided workflow execution

Instead of building a separate orchestration engine (which would require modifying every agent framework), we achieve orchestration through:
- **Smart Workflow Structures**: JSON definitions that embed orchestration logic
- **Agent Guidance**: The workflowlookup server provides next-step guidance
- **Natural Language Control Flow**: Prompts that guide agents through the workflow
- **Why not a separate component**:
    - Maintains compatibility with ALL MCP-enabled agents
    - No agent framework modifications required
    - Leverages agents' existing instruction-following capabilities
    - Simpler to deploy and maintain

### How Orchestration Actually Works

The hybrid approach achieves orchestration without a central engine:

```typescript
// Agent calls workflowlookup for guidance
Agent: "I've completed the planning step"
workflowlookup.getNextGuidance({
  workflowId: "ai-task-implementation",
  completedSteps: ["preconditions", "plan"],
  lastStepOutput: "1. Create User model\n2. Add JWT..."
})

// Server responds with orchestration guidance
Response: {
  nextStep: "implement-phase-1",
  prompt: "Now implement phase 1 using the PREP/IMPLEMENT/VERIFY pattern...",
  orchestrationHints: {
    requiresApproval: true,
    suggestedModel: "model-with-strong-tool-use",
    validationCriteria: "Code compiles and follows plan"
  }
}
```

### Architectural Rationale

**Why Not a Monolithic Approach?**
- **Coupling**: Changes to workflows would require redeploying the entire system
- **Scaling**: Different components have different scaling needs
- **Ownership**: Teams can own and evolve individual components
- **Testing**: Each component can be tested in isolation

**Why Not a Central Orchestration Engine?**
- **Agent Modification**: Would require changing every agent framework
- **Compatibility**: Would break MCP's agent-agnostic philosophy
- **Complexity**: Adds unnecessary middleware layer
- **Flexibility**: Agents can interpret guidance based on their capabilities

**Why This Hybrid Architecture Works Well**
1. **Universal Compatibility**: Works with any MCP-enabled agent out of the box
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Simple agents follow basic flows, advanced agents leverage rich guidance
3. **Modularity**: Each service has exactly one job and does it well
4. **Flexibility**: Orchestration through guidance, not rigid control
5. **Future-Proof**: Can evolve toward stricter orchestration (Option 3) if needed without breaking changes

### Future Evolution Path

While the hybrid approach provides excellent balance, the architecture supports evolution toward stricter orchestration if needed:

```
Current (Option 2): workflowlookup provides guidance → Agent interprets
Future (Option 3):  workflowlookup enforces state → Agent must comply
```

This transition would only require enhancing the workflowlookup server's state management capabilities without changing the fundamental architecture or breaking existing integrations.

## 3. Key Features & Core Concepts

### Feature: The Structured Workflow Schema

The workflow schema is the heart of the system—a JSON contract that translates best practices into
executable specifications. Every workflow adheres to this structure:

```typescript
interface Workflow {
  id: string;              // Unique identifier
  name: string;            // Human-friendly title
  description: string;     // What this workflow accomplishes
  preconditions?: string[];      // Prerequisites before starting
  clarificationPrompts?: string[]; // Questions to ask upfront
  steps: Array<{
    id: string;
    title: string;
    prompt: string;
    guidance?: string[]; // Optional tactical advice for this specific step
    askForFiles?: boolean;
    requireConfirmation?: boolean;
  }>;
  metaGuidance?: string[];  // Persistent best practices
}
```

Each field serves a critical purpose in preventing LLM failure modes:

- **`preconditions`**: Helps ensure the agent has necessary context (files, permissions, clarity)
  before
  beginning. This helps address the "missing prerequisites" problem.

- **`clarificationPrompts`**: Prompts the LLM to gather missing information upfront. No more
  discovering halfway through that a critical requirement was ambiguous.

- **`steps`**: Encourages the "one task at a time" principle. Each step is atomic, focused, and
  completable. This helps reduce scope creep and attention diffusion.

- **`metaGuidance`**: Injects expert knowledge into every interaction. These are the persistent
  reminders that keep the LLM on track.

### Feature: The Curated Workflow Library

The `workflowlookup` server hosts a growing collection of battle-tested workflows. Initial high-value workflows include:

1. **AI Task Prompt Workflow**
    - Guides through task understanding → planning → implementation → verification
   - Promotes the prep/implement/verify pattern
   - Includes comprehensive testing and code quality checks

2. **AI-Assisted Merge Request Review Workflow**
    - Systematic diff analysis
    - Categorized findings (Critical/Major/Minor)
    - Generates actionable feedback

3. **Workflow: Ticket Creation**
    - Three paths based on complexity (Fast Track/Standard/Deep Dive)
   - Helps ensure complete context gathering
    - Produces well-structured, actionable tickets

### Concept: The prep / implement / verify Execution Pattern

This pattern is a key element that helps make AI-assisted coding more reliable:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│    PREP     │ --> │  IMPLEMENT   │ --> │   VERIFY    │
│             │     │              │     │             │
│ - Read plan │     │ - Use tools  │     │ - Re-read   │
│ - Clarify   │     │ - Make edits │     │ - Validate  │
│ - Confirm   │     │ - One step   │     │ - Test      │
└─────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └─────────────┘
                            │
                            └──── Repeat for each step
```

**Why This Works:**

- **Prep**: Encourages the LLM to understand before acting
- **Implement**: Constrains action to a single, well-defined step
- **Verify**: Catches errors before they compound

This pattern directly addresses the tendency of LLMs to rush into implementation without proper understanding or to make multiple changes without verification.

### Concept: Model-Aware Workflows (Pragmatic Multi-LLM Approach)

Different models excel at different tasks. Our workflows acknowledge this reality:

- **Planning Steps**: "Use a model with superior reasoning capabilities" - leverages superior
  reasoning capabilities
- **Implementation Steps**: "Use a model with superior tool-use abilities" - leverages superior
  tool-use abilities
- **Analysis Steps**: Model choice depends on context needs

While the system doesn't automatically route between models, the workflows provide clear guidance on which model to use when. This pragmatic approach:
- Maximizes effectiveness by using each model's strengths
- Remains simple to implement and understand
- Allows users to adapt based on model availability

### Concept: Guided Best Practices Through metaGuidance

The `metaGuidance` field embeds hard-won expertise directly into workflows:

```json
"metaGuidance": [
"Always verify understanding before implementing",
"One task at a time - never combine unrelated changes",
"Request a detailed plan before any code modification",
"Add print statements for debugging, then analyze logs",
"Never use double-bangs (!!) in code"
]
```

These persistent guidelines are presented throughout execution to help keep the LLM and developer
aligned with best practices.

## 4. User Interaction Model: A Step-by-Step Flow

### How a User Would Interact With It

Let's walk through a concrete example: A developer needs to implement a new feature from ticket ACEI-1234. Here's how the orchestrated workflow guides them to success:

#### Step 1: Initiation
```
Developer: "I need to implement ticket ACEI-1234 - Add image preview to chat messages"
```

#### Step 2: Workflow Selection
The agent, via the Orchestrator, analyzes the request and suggests:
```
Agent: "I'll help you implement this feature using the AI Task Prompt Workflow. 
This will help ensure we gather all context, create a solid plan, and implement 
it step-by-step. Let me start by understanding the requirements."
```

#### Step 3: Context Gathering (Preconditions & Clarifications)
The Orchestrator executes the workflow's preconditions:
```
Agent: "Before we begin, I need to gather some information:

1. Please provide the ticket description and any related documentation
2. Which files should I examine for the current chat implementation?
3. Are there any design mockups or specifications?

[Developer provides ticket details, points to ChatViewController.swift and chat_message.xml]

Agent: "I see this involves both iOS and Android. A few clarifying questions:
- Should images be downloadable or view-only?
- What's the maximum image size we should support?
- Should we show loading states for images?"
```

#### Step 4: Planning Phase (Model-Aware Execution)
```
Agent: "Now I'll create a detailed implementation plan. 
**Please switch to a model with superior reasoning capabilities** as it excels at 
architectural reasoning and comprehensive planning."

[Developer switches to a model with superior reasoning capabilities]

Agent: "Analyzing the codebase and requirements..."
[Reads relevant files, analyzes architecture]

Agent: "Here's my implementation plan:

Phase 1: Add Image Message Model Support
- Extend ChatMessage model to include imageURL field
- Update message parsing logic
- Add image validation

Phase 2: Implement Image Display UI
- Create ImageMessageCell for iOS
- Create image_message_layout.xml for Android
- Handle aspect ratios and constraints

Phase 3: Add Loading States
- Implement progressive image loading
- Add placeholder while loading
- Handle load failures gracefully

Phase 4: Testing & Edge Cases
- Unit tests for new model fields
- UI tests for image display
- Test with various image sizes/formats

Each phase is independently committable. Shall we proceed with this plan?"
```

#### Step 5: Iterative Execution Phase
```
[Developer approves plan and switches to a model with superior tool-use abilities for implementation]

Agent: "Starting Phase 1: Add Image Message Model Support

**PREP**: Let me first examine the current ChatMessage model structure..."
[Reads files, confirms understanding]

**IMPLEMENT**: Now I'll extend the model to support images..."
[Makes focused edits to model files]

**VERIFY**: Let me verify these changes..."
[Re-reads files, checks compilation, validates logic]

Agent: "Phase 1 complete. The model now supports image messages. 
Ready to proceed to Phase 2?"
```

This pattern repeats for each phase, with the agent:
- Preparing by understanding the current state
- Implementing only the specific phase
- Verifying the changes before moving on

#### Step 6: Completion
```
Agent: "All phases completed successfully! Here's what we accomplished:

✅ Extended message models to support images
✅ Implemented UI components for both platforms
✅ Added proper loading states and error handling
✅ Created comprehensive tests

The implementation follows the existing patterns in your codebase and includes 
all requirements from ACEI-1234. Would you like me to help you prepare the 
merge request?"
```

### What The Expected Results Are

The output of this orchestrated process is:

1. **Completed Feature**: Implementation following all requirements
2. **Clean Git History**: Each phase creates logical, atomic commits
3. **Comprehensive Tests**: Testing is included in the workflow
4. **Consistent Code**: Guided to follow existing patterns and conventions
5. **Full Transparency**: Every decision and change is documented
6. **Predictable Process**: The same workflow produces more consistent quality

Most importantly, the developer is guided to avoid common pitfalls:

- The LLM being less likely to go off track
- Important context being highlighted
- Edge cases being addressed through workflow steps
- Maintaining organized, committable changes

The workflow guides both the human and the AI through a proven process, helping to produce code
that's more ready for review and integration.

## 5. Strengths & Strategic Advantages

### Guided Best Practices

Traditional AI assistants typically rely on the user's prompting skills and the LLM's training to (
hopefully) follow good practices.

Our system takes a fundamentally different approach by providing a structured, guided process
rather than leaving outcomes to chance.

**Traditional Approach:**
```
User: "Help me implement this feature"
AI: [May or may not ask for context, may or may not plan, may or may not test]
```

**Our Approach:**
```
Workflow guides: Context → Clarification → Planning → Stepped Implementation → Verification
AI: [Cannot skip steps, must follow proven patterns]
```

This moves beyond simple suggestions to provide enforceable, structured guidance.

The orchestration engine guides the process so that each required step is addressed. This means
best practices are embedded at every stage, helping to ensure more reliable results regardless of
who is using the system.

### Consistency & Reproducibility

One of the biggest challenges with AI-assisted development is inconsistency. The same request can yield wildly different approaches depending on:
- How the prompt is phrased
- The LLM's "mood" (temperature/randomness)
- Which context was included or forgotten
- The developer's prompting expertise

Our system helps reduce these variables:

- **Same Process**: Every developer follows the same workflow
- **Same Quality**: Helps junior developers produce work closer to senior-level quality
- **Same Standards**: Code style and patterns are guided by workflows
- **Audit Trail**: Every decision is logged and reviewable

A junior developer using our system will be guided to produce code that's more architecturally sound
and well-tested, because the workflow guides them through the necessary steps.

### Modularity & Scalability

The system grows with your needs without architectural changes:

**Adding New Capabilities:**
```json
// Simply create a new workflow JSON
{
  "id": "security-audit-workflow",
  "name": "Security Vulnerability Audit",
  "steps": [...]
}
```

**Integrating New Tools:**
```
// Add a new MCP server
securityScanner Server → Integrates seamlessly with existing workflows
```

**Adapting to New Models:**
```
// Update workflow guidance
"preferredModel": "a model with superior capabilities"  // When it releases
```

No code changes required to the core system. New workflows are just data.

### Clarity & Onboarding

Traditional AI agent codebases are often inscrutable. Ours is self-documenting:

**For New Developers:**
- Read workflow JSON to understand exactly what will happen
- Every workflow follows the same schema
- No hidden prompt engineering magic

**For Workflow Authors:**
- Clear schema with examples
- Can see exactly how other workflows work
- Test workflows without touching core code

**For Organizations:**
- Standardize practices across teams
- Onboard new team members faster
- Preserve institutional knowledge

### Risk Mitigation

The system provides strategies to address the major risks of AI-assisted development:

#### Risk Mitigation Strategies

| Risk               | How We Address It                                         |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hallucination**  | Verification steps help catch fabrications                |
| **Scope Creep**    | One-step-at-a-time execution helps reduce runaway changes |
| **Context Loss**   | Explicit context management and state tracking            |
| **Inconsistency**  | Structured workflows promote more predictable outputs     |
| **Poor Testing**   | Testing steps are included in workflows                   |
| **Technical Debt** | Guided patterns encourage better solutions                |

### Competitive Advantages

**Versus Raw LLM Usage:**

- Significantly more reliable based on structured approach
- More predictable, repeatable results
- Built-in quality guidance

**Versus Other AI Coding Tools:**
- Not dependent on a specific IDE
- Works with any LLM that supports tool use
- Workflows are version-controlled and shareable

**Versus Traditional Development:**

- Can be faster than manual implementation for complex tasks
- Promotes more consistent practices than human-only development
- Helps capture and share best practices across teams

### Real-World Impact

Based on the structured approach and guided best practices, we expect the following improvements:

- **Reduced bug introduction** through included verification steps
- **Faster feature development** through clear, step-by-step guidance
- **More consistent code quality** across developers of all skill levels
- **Improved onboarding** as junior developers receive structured guidance

While we cannot directly measure code quality from the MCP server, we can track:
- Which workflows are used most frequently
- Completion rates and patterns
- Common failure points that need improvement
- Usage trends that inform workflow development

These metrics help us continuously improve the workflows themselves, which in turn supports the
expected quality improvements.

## 6. Current Limitations & Future Directions

### What Are Its Weaknesses

We believe in transparency about our system's current limitations. Understanding these helps set appropriate expectations and guides our improvement efforts.

#### 1. Curation Bottleneck

The system's effectiveness is directly proportional to the quality and coverage of workflows in the
library.

- Creating high-quality workflows requires deep expertise.
- The initial workflows were created by practitioners with years of experience.
- Not all development patterns have been captured yet.
- Workflow creation is currently a manual, time-intensive process.

The impact of this limitation is that teams may need to invest significant time creating workflows
for their specific use cases before seeing full benefits.

#### 2. Manual Model Selection

**The Challenge**: Users must manually switch between LLMs based on workflow guidance.

```
Current Experience:
"Please switch to a model with superior reasoning capabilities for this planning step"
[User manually switches]

Ideal Experience:
[System automatically routes to optimal model]
```

**Impact**: Adds cognitive overhead and requires users to have access to multiple LLM providers.

#### 3. State Management Complexity

**The Challenge**: Sophisticated user requests require complex state handling:

- "Go back two steps and try a different approach"
- "Pause here, I need to check something with my team"
- "Resume from yesterday where we left off"
- "Show me what would happen if we chose option B instead"

**Impact**: Currently limited to linear execution, reducing flexibility for exploratory development.

#### 4. Workflow Rigidity

**The Challenge**: Workflows are prescriptive by design, but this can feel constraining:

- Experienced developers may want to skip "obvious" steps
- Emergency fixes need faster paths
- Some tasks don't fit neatly into existing workflows

**Impact**: May frustrate advanced users or slow down simple tasks.

#### 5. Integration Limitations

**The Challenge**: The system requires specific infrastructure:

- Agent framework must support multiple MCP servers
- LLMs must have tool-use capabilities
- Organization needs access to multiple LLM providers

**Impact**: Not all teams can immediately adopt the system.

- **Researchers**: Help us measure and improve effectiveness

### Conclusion

Despite current limitations, the Workflow Orchestration System represents a significant step forward
in AI-assisted development. By acknowledging these constraints and actively working to address them,
we're building toward a future where AI doesn't just assist with coding—it helps elevate the entire
development process.

The journey from "AI that can code" to "AI that codes the right way, every time" is ongoing, but the foundation is solid and the path is clear.

## 7. Workflow Authoring Guide

### Best Practices for Creating New Workflows

Creating effective workflows is both an art and a science. Follow these principles to ensure your workflows guide users to success.

#### 1. Start with Clear Outcomes

**❌ Bad**: "Implement feature"
**✅ Good**: "Implement user authentication with email/password, including signup, login, and password reset flows"

Your workflow should have a specific, measurable outcome. Users should know exactly what they'll have when finished.

#### 2. Break Down Complex Tasks Intelligently

**The Chunking Principle**: Each step should be:
- **Atomic**: Completable independently
- **Testable**: Has clear success criteria
- **Committable**: Could be a standalone git commit

**Example Breakdown**:
```json
// ❌ Too Large
{
  "title": "Build the entire authentication system",
  "prompt": "Implement user auth with all features"
}

// ✅ Just Right
{
  "title": "Create User model and database schema",
  "prompt": "Create a User model with email, hashed_password, and created_at fields. Include database migrations."
}
```

#### 3. Write Crystal Clear Prompts

Your prompts are instructions for both the LLM and the user. Make them unambiguous:

```json
{
  "prompt": "Examine the existing UserController class in src/controllers/user_controller.rb. Identify the current authentication method (likely in the 'authenticate' method). Create a new method called 'authenticate_with_jwt' that:\n\n1. Extracts the JWT token from the Authorization header\n2. Validates the token using the existing JWT library\n3. Returns the user object if valid, raises AuthenticationError if not\n4. Includes appropriate error handling for malformed tokens\n\nMaintain the existing code style and patterns."
}
```

#### 4. Use Preconditions Wisely

Preconditions prevent the workflow from starting with missing context:

```json
"preconditions": [
"User has provided the authentication requirements document",
"Database connection is configured and tested",
"JWT secret key is available in environment variables",
"Existing User model or specification is available"
]
```

#### 5. Craft Effective Clarification Prompts

These questions catch ambiguities before they cause problems:

```json
"clarificationPrompts": [
"What should happen when a user tries to login with an unverified email?",
"Should we implement rate limiting for login attempts? If so, what limits?",
"Do you need to support social login (Google, GitHub, etc.) or just email/password?",
"What session duration do you want? Should it be configurable?"
]
```

### Common Patterns and Anti-Patterns

#### ✅ Effective Patterns

**The Investigation Step**
```json
{
  "id": "investigate-current-state",
  "title": "Analyze existing authentication implementation",
  "prompt": "Using grep and file reading tools, map out the current authentication flow. Document: entry points, middleware, user model structure, and any existing auth utilities.",
  "requireConfirmation": true
}
```

**The Planning Step**
```json
{
  "id": "create-implementation-plan",
  "title": "Create detailed implementation plan",
  "prompt": "Based on the investigation, create a step-by-step plan for adding JWT authentication. Include: affected files, new files needed, testing approach, and migration strategy.",
  "requireConfirmation": true
}
```

**The Verification Step**
```json
{
  "id": "verify-implementation",
  "title": "Verify JWT authentication works correctly",
  "prompt": "Test the implementation by: 1) Creating a test user, 2) Authenticating to get a JWT, 3) Using the JWT to access a protected endpoint, 4) Verifying invalid tokens are rejected. Fix any issues found."
}
```

#### ❌ Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**The Kitchen Sink Step**
```json
// DON'T DO THIS
{
  "title": "Implement everything",
  "prompt": "Add authentication, authorization, user management, password reset, email verification, and admin features"
}
```

**The Vague Instruction**
```json
// DON'T DO THIS  
{
  "prompt": "Make the authentication better"
}
```

**The Context-Free Step**
```json
// DON'T DO THIS
{
  "prompt": "Add JWT validation",
  // Missing: where? how? what library? what error handling?
}
```

### How to Test and Validate Workflows

#### 1. Dry Run Testing
Before publishing, manually walk through your workflow:
- Can each step be completed with only the information provided?
- Are there hidden dependencies between steps?
- Do the prompts make sense in sequence?

#### 2. User Testing
Have someone unfamiliar with the task try your workflow:
- Where do they get confused?
- What questions do they ask?
- Where do they deviate from the intended path?

#### 3. Edge Case Testing
Consider failure modes:
- What if a precondition isn't actually met?
- What if a step fails partway through?
- Can the user recover gracefully?

#### 4. Model Testing
Test with different LLMs:
- Do the prompts work with both Claude and Gemini?
- Are model-specific instructions clear?
- Do results remain consistent?

### Workflow Template

Here's a starter template for new workflows:

```json
{
  "id": "your-workflow-id",
  "name": "Human-Friendly Workflow Name",
  "description": "Clear description of what this workflow accomplishes",
  "preconditions": [
    "List of things that must be true/available before starting"
  ],
  "clarificationPrompts": [
    "Questions to resolve ambiguities before beginning"
  ],
  "metaGuidance": [
    "Principles that apply throughout the workflow",
    "E.g., 'Always write tests for new functions'",
    "E.g., 'Follow existing code style'"
  ],
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "investigate",
      "title": "Understand current state",
      "prompt": "Detailed investigation instructions...",
      "requireConfirmation": true
    },
    {
      "id": "plan",
      "title": "Create implementation plan",
      "prompt": "Planning instructions...",
      "requireConfirmation": true
    },
    {
      "id": "implement-part-1",
      "title": "Implement [specific feature]",
      "prompt": "Implementation instructions...",
      "askForFiles": true
    },
    {
      "id": "test",
      "title": "Test the implementation",
      "prompt": "Testing instructions..."
    }
  ]
}
```

Remember: Great workflows don't just accomplish tasks—they teach best practices and help ensure
consistent, high-quality results across all users.

## 8. Technical Specifications

### How MCP Servers Work

The workflowlookup server follows the MCP (Model Context Protocol) standard:
- Runs locally on the user's machine
- Communicates via stdio (standard input/output)
- No network ports or hosting required
- Spawned as a subprocess by the agent

### Workflow Storage

Workflows are stored locally on the user's filesystem:

**Default Location Options:**
```
~/.modelcontextprotocol/workflows/     # User's home directory
./node_modules/@mc.../workflows/       # Bundled with npm package
$MCP_WORKFLOWS_DIR/                    # Environment variable override
```

**Directory Structure:**
```
workflows/
  core/               # Bundled production-ready workflows
    ai-task-implementation.json
    mr-review.json
    ticket-creation.json
  custom/             # User's custom workflows
    my-team-workflow.json
  community/          # Downloaded community workflows
    awesome-workflow.json
```

### Tool Specifications

The workflowlookup server exposes tools via MCP's JSON-RPC protocol:

```typescript
// List all available workflows
tool: "workflow_list"
returns: {
  workflows: Array<{
    id: string
    name: string
    description: string
    category: string
    version: string
  }>
}

// Get a specific workflow
tool: "workflow_get"
arguments: {
  id: string
}
returns: Workflow  // Full workflow JSON

// Get next step guidance (core orchestration feature)
tool: "workflow_next"
arguments: {
  workflowId: string
  currentStep?: string
  completedSteps: string[]
  context?: Record<string, any>
}
returns: {
  step: Step
  guidance: {
    prompt: string
    modelHint?: string
    requiresConfirmation?: boolean
    validationCriteria?: string[]
  }
  isComplete: boolean
}

// Validate step output
tool: "workflow_validate"
arguments: {
  workflowId: string
  stepId: string
  output: string
}
returns: {
  valid: boolean
  issues?: string[]
  suggestions?: string[]
}
```

### Installation & Configuration

Users install the server via npm and configure their agent:

**Installation:**
```bash
# Global installation
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-workflow-lookup

# Or use npx (no installation needed)
npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-workflow-lookup
```

**Adding Custom Workflows:**
```bash
# Create custom workflows directory
mkdir -p ~/.modelcontextprotocol/workflows/custom

# Add your workflow
cp my-workflow.json ~/.modelcontextprotocol/workflows/custom/
```

### Security Model

Since the server runs locally, security is simplified:

**Local Execution:**
- No authentication needed (local process)
- No network exposure
- Runs with user's permissions
- Workflows are just JSON (no code execution)

**Workflow Validation:**
- JSON schema validation on load
- Malformed workflows are skipped with warnings
- No dynamic code execution
- Template variables are safely handled

### Security Considerations

While the local-first architecture provides inherent security benefits, organizations should
consider these additional security aspects:

**Workflow JSON Security:**

- Workflows should be validated against a strict JSON schema to prevent injection attacks
- Path traversal protection must be enforced for custom workflow directories
- Workflow file names should be sanitized to prevent directory escape attempts
- Maximum file size limits should be enforced to prevent resource exhaustion

**Resource Limits:**

- Maximum workflow complexity (number of steps) should be configurable
- Individual prompt size limits prevent memory exhaustion
- Recursive workflow references must be detected and prevented
- Concurrent workflow execution limits may be needed for resource management

**Input Validation:**

- All user inputs passed to workflows should be sanitized
- Template variable substitution must escape special characters
- File paths in workflow definitions should be validated against allowed directories
- External tool references should be whitelisted

**Audit and Monitoring:**

- Workflow execution should be logged for security auditing
- Failed validation attempts should be tracked
- Unusual usage patterns should trigger alerts
- Sensitive data in workflow logs should be redacted

**Best Practices:**

- Store custom workflows in version control for change tracking
- Review community workflows before installation
- Implement workflow signing for trusted sources
- Regular security updates of the MCP server and dependencies

### Versioning Strategy

**Workflow Versioning:**
```json
{
  "id": "ai-task-implementation",
  "version": "2.1.0",
  "minServerVersion": "1.0.0",
  "changelog": {
    "2.1.0": "Added validation step",
    "2.0.0": "New prep/implement/verify pattern"
  }
}
```

**Server Versioning:**
- Server version in package.json
- Workflows specify minimum server version
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Clear upgrade path for breaking changes

**Workflow Updates:**
```bash
# Update bundled workflows
npm update @modelcontextprotocol/server-workflow-lookup

# Or pull latest community workflows
workflow-lookup update community
```

### Development & Testing

**Running Locally for Development:**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repo]
cd server-workflow-lookup

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# Test with MCP inspector
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

**Testing Workflows:**
```bash
# Validate workflow JSON
workflow-lookup validate my-workflow.json

# Test workflow execution
workflow-lookup test ai-task-implementation --dry-run
```

This local-first approach ensures privacy, simplicity, and ease of customization while maintaining the power of structured workflow orchestration.

#### Configuration Options

**Disable Thought Logging:**
To disable logging of thought information, set the environment variable:
```bash
DISABLE_THOUGHT_LOGGING=true
```

#### Building from Source

**Docker Build Commands:**
```bash
# Build sequential thinking server
docker build -t mcp/sequentialthinking -f src/sequentialthinking/Dockerfile .

# Build workflow lookup server
docker build -t mcp/workflowlookup -f src/workflowlookup/Dockerfile .
```

#### Workflow Discovery and Selection

```kotlin
// WorkflowOrchestrator.kt
class WorkflowOrchestrator(
    private val workflowLookup: WorkflowLookupClient,
    private val thinking: SequentialThinkingClient,
    private val agent: FirebenderAgent
) {
    suspend fun discoverWorkflows(userQuery: String): List<WorkflowSummary> {
        // List all available workflows
        val workflows = workflowLookup.list()

        // Use agent to select most relevant workflow
        val prompt = """
            User request: "$userQuery"
            
            Available workflows:
            ${workflows.joinToString("\n") { "- ${it.id}: ${it.name}" }}
            
            Which workflow best matches this request? Consider the workflow descriptions
            and return the most appropriate workflow ID.
        """

        val selectedId = agent.query(prompt)
        return workflows.filter { it.id == selectedId }
    }
}
```

#### Example API Calls and Responses

**Listing Workflows**
```kotlin
// Request
val request = WorkflowLookupRequest(
    action = "list"
)

// Response
val response = WorkflowListResponse(
    workflows = listOf(
        WorkflowSummary(
            id = "ai-task-implementation",
            name = "AI Task Prompt Workflow",
            description = "Guides through task understanding → planning → implementation → verification"
        ),
        WorkflowSummary(
            id = "mr-review",
            name = "AI-Assisted Merge Request Review Workflow",
            description = "Systematic diff analysis with categorized findings"
        )
    )
)
```

**Retrieving a Specific Workflow**
```kotlin
// Request
val request = WorkflowLookupRequest(
    action = "retrieve",
    workflowId = "ai-task-implementation"
)

// Response
val response = WorkflowDetail(
    id = "ai-task-implementation",
    name = "AI Task Prompt Workflow",
    description = "Complete task implementation with verification",
    preconditions = listOf(
        "Task description is clear and complete",
        "Relevant codebase files are accessible",
        "Success criteria are defined"
    ),
    clarificationPrompts = listOf(
        "What are the explicit acceptance criteria?",
        "Are there any technical constraints I should be aware of?",
        "Which files should I examine first?"
    ),
    steps = listOf(
        Step(
            id = "understand",
            title = "Deep understanding of task and codebase",
            prompt = "Analyze the task description and examine relevant code...",
            requireConfirmation = true
        ),
        Step(
            id = "plan",
            title = "Create implementation plan",
            prompt = "Based on your understanding, create a step-by-step plan...",
            requireConfirmation = true
        )
        // ... more steps
    )
)
```

#### Executing a Workflow Step

```kotlin
class WorkflowExecutor {
    suspend fun executeStep(
        workflow: WorkflowDetail,
        step: Step,
        context: WorkflowContext
    ): StepResult {
        // Log the step initiation
        thinking.log(
            ThinkingEntry(
                workflowId = workflow.id,
                stepId = step.id,
                content = "Beginning step: ${step.title}",
                timestamp = Instant.now()
            )
        )

        // Prepare the prompt with context
        val fullPrompt = buildString {
            // Include meta guidance
            workflow.metaGuidance?.forEach { guidance ->
                appendLine("IMPORTANT: $guidance")
            }
            appendLine()

            // Include step-specific prompt
            appendLine(step.prompt)
            appendLine()

            // Include context from previous steps
            appendLine("Context from previous steps:")
            context.previousResults.forEach { result ->
                appendLine("- ${result.stepId}: ${result.summary}")
            }
        }

        // Execute via agent
        val result = if (step.requireConfirmation) {
            agent.queryWithConfirmation(fullPrompt)
        } else {
            agent.query(fullPrompt)
        }

        // Log the completion
        thinking.log(
            ThinkingEntry(
                workflowId = workflow.id,
                stepId = step.id,
                content = "Completed: $result",
                timestamp = Instant.now()
            )
        )

        return StepResult(
            stepId = step.id,
            success = true,
            output = result,
            summary = extractSummary(result)
        )
    }
}
```

#### Error Handling Patterns

```kotlin
class RobustWorkflowOrchestrator {
    suspend fun executeWorkflowWithRecovery(
        workflowId: String,
        context: UserContext
    ): WorkflowResult {
        return try {
            // Retrieve workflow
            val workflow = workflowLookup.retrieve(workflowId)
                ?: throw WorkflowNotFoundException(workflowId)

            // Validate preconditions
            val unmetPreconditions = validatePreconditions(workflow, context)
            if (unmetPreconditions.isNotEmpty()) {
                return WorkflowResult.PreconditionsFailed(unmetPreconditions)
            }

            // Execute clarifications if needed
            val clarifications = executeClarifications(workflow, context)

            // Execute steps with recovery
            val results = mutableListOf<StepResult>()
            for (step in workflow.steps) {
                try {
                    val result = executeStep(workflow, step, context)
                    results.add(result)
                } catch (e: StepExecutionException) {
                    // Allow user to retry, skip, or abort
                    when (promptUserForRecovery(step, e)) {
                        RecoveryAction.RETRY -> {
                            // Retry the step
                            results.add(executeStep(workflow, step, context))
                        }
                        RecoveryAction.SKIP -> {
                            // Log skip and continue
                            thinking.log(
                                ThinkingEntry(
                                    workflowId = workflow.id,
                                    stepId = step.id,
                                    content = "Step skipped due to error: ${e.message}",
                                    type = EntryType.WARNING
                                )
                            )
                        }
                        RecoveryAction.ABORT -> {
                            return WorkflowResult.Aborted(results)
                        }
                    }
                }
            }

            WorkflowResult.Success(results)

        } catch (e: Exception) {
            WorkflowResult.SystemError(e.message ?: "Unknown error")
        }
    }
}
```

#### State Management Integration

```kotlin
// WorkflowState.kt
data class WorkflowState(
    val workflowId: String,
    val currentStepIndex: Int,
    val completedSteps: List<StepResult>,
    val context: Map<String, Any>,
    val startTime: Instant,
    val lastUpdateTime: Instant
)

// Saving state for resumption
class StatefulWorkflowOrchestrator {
    suspend fun saveState(state: WorkflowState) {
        val serialized = Json.encodeToString(state)
        thinking.log(
            ThinkingEntry(
                workflowId = state.workflowId,
                stepId = "state-save",
                content = serialized,
                type = EntryType.STATE_CHECKPOINT
            )
        )
    }

    suspend fun resumeWorkflow(workflowId: String): WorkflowState? {
        val entries = thinking.getEntries(workflowId, type = EntryType.STATE_CHECKPOINT)
        return entries.lastOrNull()?.let { entry ->
            Json.decodeFromString<WorkflowState>(entry.content)
        }
    }
}
```

### Complete Integration Example

Here's how all the pieces come together in a real usage scenario:

```kotlin
// Main orchestration flow
class FirebenderWorkflowIntegration {
    suspend fun handleUserRequest(request: String) {
        // 1. Discover appropriate workflow
        val workflows = orchestrator.discoverWorkflows(request)
        val selected = agent.confirmSelection(workflows)

        // 2. Retrieve full workflow
        val workflow = workflowLookup.retrieve(selected.id)

        // 3. Check preconditions
        val context = gatherContext(workflow.preconditions)

        // 4. Execute clarifications
        val clarifications = orchestrator.executeClarifications(
            workflow.clarificationPrompts,
            context
        )

        // 5. Begin step execution with appropriate model
        workflow.steps.forEach { step ->
            // Notify user of model preference
            if (step.id.contains("plan")) {
                agent.notify(
                    "Switching to a model with superior reasoning capabilities for planning..."
                )
            } else if (step.id.contains("implement")) {
                agent.notify(
                    "Switching to a model with superior tool-use abilities for implementation..."
                )
            }

            // Execute with state tracking
            val result = orchestrator.executeStep(workflow, step, context)
            context.addResult(result)

            // Save state after each step
            orchestrator.saveState(
                WorkflowState(
                    workflowId = workflow.id,
                    currentStepIndex = workflow.steps.indexOf(step),
                    completedSteps = context.results,
                    context = context.data,
                    startTime = context.startTime,
                    lastUpdateTime = Instant.now()
                )
            )
        }

        // 6. Generate final summary
        val summary = orchestrator.generateSummary(workflow, context)
        agent.present(summary)
    }
}
```

These examples demonstrate the clean separation of concerns and the practical integration patterns that make the Workflow Orchestration System both powerful and maintainable.

## 10. Metrics and Success Criteria

### How to Measure if the System is Working Well

The effectiveness of the Workflow Orchestration System must be measured through a combination of direct server metrics and indirect quality indicators. We're transparent about what we can and cannot measure directly.

### What We Can Directly Measure

#### 1. Workflow Usage Metrics

**Workflow Adoption**
```
Definition: Number of unique workflows accessed per day/week/month
Measurement: Server API logs
Indicates: Which workflows provide most value
```

**Workflow Completion Patterns**
```
Definition: Sequence of steps requested for each workflow session
Measurement: /next endpoint call patterns
Reveals: Where users get stuck or abandon workflows
```

**Step Success Rates**
```
Definition: Ratio of successful validations to total validation requests
Measurement: /validate endpoint responses
Indicates: Which steps are well-designed vs problematic
```

#### 2. Server Performance Metrics

**API Response Times**
```
- Workflow retrieval: <100ms (p95)
- Next step guidance: <200ms (p95)
- Validation requests: <150ms (p95)
```

**Availability**
```
- Server uptime: >99.9%
- Workflow retrieval success rate: >99.95%
```

**Usage Patterns**
```
- Peak usage times
- Average session duration
- Geographic distribution
```

### What We Hope to Achieve (Hypotheses)

Based on the structured approach, we hypothesize these improvements:

#### 1. Code Quality Improvements

**Hypothesis**: Included verification steps reduce bug introduction
**Proxy Metrics**:
- Voluntary user feedback scores
- Anecdotal reports from code reviews
- Case studies from willing teams

#### 2. Development Efficiency
**Hypothesis**: Step-by-step guidance accelerates development
**Proxy Metrics**:
- Workflow completion times (when voluntarily reported)
- Number of clarification steps needed over time
- User surveys on perceived time savings

#### 3. Consistency Across Teams
**Hypothesis**: Structured workflows standardize practices
**Proxy Metrics**:
- Adoption rates across different teams
- Workflow customization requests (fewer = more universal fit)
- Feedback on workflow clarity and completeness

#### Optional Client-Side Feedback
```typescript
// Voluntary metrics endpoint
POST /api/v1/metrics/feedback
{
  workflowId: "ai-task-implementation",
  sessionId: "uuid-here",
  feedback: {
    helpful: true,
    rating: 4,
    timesSaved: "approximately 2 hours",
    wouldUseAgain: true,
    comments: "Planning step was very thorough"
  }
}
```

### Success Criteria (Measurable)

The system is considered successful when:

1. **Adoption**: >100 workflow executions per day across all workflows
2. **Completion**: >70% of started workflows reach completion
3. **Performance**: 95th percentile response time <200ms
4. **Reliability**: >99.9% uptime
5. **Growth**: Month-over-month increase in unique users

### Success Indicators (Qualitative)

Additional signs of success that we actively collect:

1. **User Testimonials**: Developers voluntarily share positive experiences
2. **Workflow Contributions**: Community submits new workflows
3. **Integration Requests**: Other tools want to integrate with the system
4. **Case Studies**: Teams willing to share their success stories
5. **Organic Growth**: Usage grows through word-of-mouth

### Continuous Improvement Process

Monthly reviews examine:
- **Usage Data**: Which workflows are trending up/down?
- **Abandonment Points**: Where do users stop following workflows?
- **Performance Metrics**: Any degradation in response times?
- **User Feedback**: What improvements are being requested?
- **Error Patterns**: Common validation failures that indicate unclear steps

By focusing on what we can actually measure while being transparent about our improvement hypotheses, we maintain credibility while working toward our vision of better AI-assisted development.

## Appendix: Integration with Other MCP Servers

### Potential Integration with sequentialthinking

The `sequentialthinking` MCP server is an existing tool designed for tracking chains of thought with revision and branching capabilities. While not required for the Workflow Orchestration System, it could potentially complement workflow execution by providing thought tracking.

**What sequentialthinking does:**
- Tracks multi-step reasoning processes
- Supports revision of previous thoughts
- Enables branching thought paths
- Provides formatted thought visualization

**Potential Integration Points:**
```json
// In workflow JSON
{
  "steps": [{
    "id": "plan",
    "title": "Create implementation plan",
    "prompt": "Create a detailed plan...",
    "suggestedTools": ["sequentialthinking"],
    "toolUsageHint": "Use sequentialthinking to track your planning process"
  }]
}
```

**Important Caveats:**
- Integration is untested and experimental
- Not required for workflow functionality
- May add complexity without clear benefit
- Agents would need both MCP servers configured

**Configuration if testing integration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-lookup": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-workflow-lookup"]
    },
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
    }
  }
}
```

The Workflow Orchestration System is designed to work independently, with or without additional MCP servers. Any integration with tools like `sequentialthinking` should be evaluated based on actual value provided versus added complexity.

## Appendix: Future Enhancement - Non-Linear Workflow Execution

### Overview

While the current linear execution model is sufficient for MVP, real-world development often
requires more flexibility. This section outlines a potential upgrade to support non-linear workflow
execution within the MCP framework.

### Core Concept: Execution State Graph

Instead of tracking a linear sequence of completed steps, an enhanced workflowlookup server could
maintain an execution graph where:

- **Nodes** represent workflow states (completed steps + context)
- **Edges** represent transitions (forward progress, branching, backtracking, or merging)
- **Current Position** tracks active node(s) in the graph

### Enhanced MCP Tools

The non-linear model would introduce new tools while maintaining backward compatibility:

```typescript
// Create a branch point for exploring alternatives
tool: "workflow_branch"
arguments: {
  workflowId: string
  fromState: string  // Node ID to branch from
  branchName: string
  reason: string
}
returns: {
  branchId: string
  newStateId: string
}

// Return to a previous state
tool: "workflow_backtrack"
arguments: {
  workflowId: string
  targetStateId: string
  reason: string
}
returns: {
  stateId: string
  stepsToRevert: string[]
}

// Merge results from different branches
tool: "workflow_merge"
arguments: {
  workflowId: string
  branchIds: string[]
  mergeStrategy: "union" | "intersection" | "manual"
}
returns: {
  mergedStateId: string
  conflicts?: Array<{step: string, branches: string[]}>
}

// Visualize execution graph
tool: "workflow_state_tree"
arguments: {
  workflowId: string
}
returns: {
  graph: {
    nodes: Array<{id: string, step: string, branch?: string}>
    edges: Array<{from: string, to: string, type: string}>
    currentNodes: string[]
  }
}
```

### Enhanced Workflow Schema

Workflows could support branching and merge points:

```json
{
  "id": "feature-implementation-exploratory",
  "executionMode": "non-linear",
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "design-approach",
      "title": "Design implementation approach",
      "branches": [
        {
          "id": "approach-a",
          "condition": "Performance-focused implementation",
          "steps": ["optimize-algorithm", "benchmark"]
        },
        {
          "id": "approach-b",
          "condition": "Simplicity-focused implementation",
          "steps": ["simple-implementation", "document"]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "implementation",
      "title": "Implement chosen approach",
      "allowBacktrack": true,
      "checkpoints": true
    }
  ],
  "mergePoints": [
    {
      "id": "final-review",
      "afterSteps": ["approach-a", "approach-b"],
      "mergeStrategy": "manual"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example User Interaction

```
User: "Let's try implementing this with approach A"
Agent: [Executes approach A steps]

User: "Actually, I want to see what approach B would look like too"
Agent: "I'll create a branch to explore approach B while preserving approach A"
[Creates branch, implements approach B]

User: "Show me both implementations"
Agent: [Uses workflow_state_tree to show both branches]

User: "Let's go with approach A but use the error handling from approach B"
Agent: "I'll merge the relevant parts"
[Uses workflow_merge with manual strategy]
```

### Benefits of Non-Linear Execution

1. **Exploratory Development**: Try multiple approaches without losing work
2. **Safe Experimentation**: Backtrack when assumptions prove incorrect
3. **Parallel Investigation**: Explore different solutions simultaneously
4. **Direct Comparison**: Evaluate different approaches side-by-side
5. **Selective Merging**: Combine the best aspects of different attempts

### Implementation Considerations

- **State Management**: The server would maintain a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) of execution states
- **Backward Compatibility**: Linear workflows would work unchanged as a special case
- **Agent Autonomy**: The system would still provide guidance rather than control
- **Persistence**: State graphs would need robust storage and recovery mechanisms

This enhancement would maintain the MCP philosophy while enabling the flexibility required for
complex, real-world development scenarios.

## Appendix: Future Enhancement - Dynamic Adaptation

### Overview

Dynamic adaptation would allow workflows to intelligently adjust their behavior based on runtime
signals while maintaining the MCP philosophy of guidance over control. Rather than static execution,
workflows would respond to user expertise, model capabilities, task complexity, and execution
history.

### Core Concept: Adaptation Context Engine

The workflowlookup server would maintain an adaptation context that influences how workflows
execute:

```typescript
interface AdaptationContext {
  userProfile: {
    expertiseLevel: "novice" | "intermediate" | "expert"
    domainKnowledge: Map<string, number>  // domain -> proficiency
    executionHistory: WorkflowHistory[]
    preferences: UserPreferences
  }
  modelCapabilities: {
    strengths: string[]
    weaknesses: string[]
    contextWindow: number
    toolUseReliability: number
  }
  taskAnalysis: {
    complexity: number
    riskLevel: "low" | "medium" | "high"
    estimatedDuration: number
    similarTasksCompleted: number
  }
  environmentFactors: {
    timeConstraints?: string
    teamContext?: string
    productionReadiness: boolean
  }
}
```

### New MCP Tools for Dynamic Adaptation

The adaptation system would introduce new tools while maintaining backward compatibility:

```typescript
// Analyze task and recommend adaptations
tool: "workflow_analyze_context"
arguments: {
  workflowId: string
  taskDescription: string
  userContext?: Partial<AdaptationContext>
}
returns: {
  recommendedAdaptations: Array<{
    type: "skip" | "expand" | "simplify" | "add_validation"
    stepId: string
    reason: string
    confidence: number
  }>
  complexityScore: number
  estimatedDuration: number
}

// Get adapted workflow based on context
tool: "workflow_get_adapted"
arguments: {
  workflowId: string
  adaptationContext: AdaptationContext
  adaptationLevel: "minimal" | "moderate" | "aggressive"
}
returns: {
  workflow: Workflow  // Dynamically modified version
  adaptations: Array<{
    stepId: string
    modification: string
    reason: string
  }>
  confidence: number
}

// Record execution feedback for learning
tool: "workflow_record_feedback"
arguments: {
  workflowId: string
  stepId: string
  outcome: "success" | "failure" | "skipped"
  duration: number
  userSatisfaction?: number
  notes?: string
}
returns: {
  recorded: boolean
  patternsDetected?: string[]
}
```

### Enhanced Workflow Schema with Adaptation Rules

Workflows could include rules for dynamic adaptation:

```json
{
  "id": "adaptive-feature-implementation",
  "name": "Adaptive Feature Implementation",
  "adaptationRules": {
    "skipConditions": [
      {
        "stepId": "basic-setup",
        "when": {
          "userExpertise": ">= intermediate",
          "similarTasksCompleted": ">= 3"
        },
        "confidence": 0.8
      }
    ],
    "expansionTriggers": [
      {
        "stepId": "implementation",
        "when": {
          "previousStepErrors": ">= 2",
          "taskComplexity": ">= 0.7"
        },
        "action": "add_substeps",
        "substeps": ["review-approach", "implement-incrementally", "test-each-part"]
      }
    ],
    "simplificationRules": [
      {
        "when": {
          "modelContextWindow": "< 8000",
          "stepPromptLength": "> 2000"
        },
        "action": "use_condensed_prompts"
      }
    ]
  },
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "planning",
      "adaptiveVersions": {
        "expert": {
          "prompt": "Create implementation plan focusing on architecture decisions..."
        },
        "intermediate": {
          "prompt": "Create a detailed plan covering: architecture, implementation steps, testing strategy..."
        },
        "novice": {
          "prompt": "Let's break this down step by step. First, what are the main components needed?...",
          "additionalGuidance": ["Consider existing patterns", "Think about error cases"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Adaptation Strategies

#### 1. Expertise-Based Adaptation

- **Novice users**: Add detailed explanations, examples, confirmation steps, and learning resources
- **Expert users**: Skip basic steps, allow step combination, reduce confirmations
- **Domain specialists**: Customize based on specific domain knowledge

#### 2. Model-Aware Adaptation

- **Limited context windows**: Break down prompts, summarize previous steps, use compression
- **Weak tool-use models**: Simplify tool steps, add validation, provide fallbacks
- **Strong reasoning models**: Allow more complex planning and architectural steps

#### 3. Task Complexity Adaptation

- **High-risk changes**: Add review steps, mandatory testing, rollback planning
- **Simple tasks**: Combine steps, reduce overhead, fast-track execution
- **Unknown complexity**: Start conservative, adapt based on early steps

### Example Adaptation Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Expert User, Simple Task**

```
User: "Add a new field to the User model"
System: [Detects expert user + simple task]

Adapted Workflow:
- Skips "understand current architecture" (user knows it)
- Combines "plan" and "implement" steps
- Maintains "test" step (always required)
- Total steps: 2 instead of 5
```

**Scenario 2: Novice User, Complex Task**

```
User: "Implement OAuth2 authentication"
System: [Detects novice user + complex task]

Adapted Workflow:
- Expands "understand requirements" with OAuth2 primer
- Adds "review auth libraries" step
- Breaks "implementation" into 5 sub-steps
- Adds "security checklist" validation
- Includes learning resources
- Total steps: 12 instead of 5
```

### Benefits of Dynamic Adaptation

1. **Personalized Experience**: Each user gets workflows suited to their level
2. **Efficiency Gains**: Experts skip redundant steps, novices get needed guidance
3. **Higher Success Rates**: Adaptations prevent common failure patterns
4. **Model Flexibility**: Works optimally across different LLM capabilities
5. **Continuous Improvement**: System learns and improves from usage
6. **Context Awareness**: Responds to task complexity and risk levels

### Implementation Considerations

- **Privacy**: User profiling must be optional and transparent
- **Predictability**: Adaptations should be explainable, not magic
- **Override Control**: Users can always force standard execution
- **Gradual Rollout**: Start with simple rule-based adaptations
- **A/B Testing**: Compare adapted vs. standard execution outcomes
- **Feedback Loops**: Clear mechanisms for users to correct bad adaptations

This enhancement would transform the workflow system from a static guide to an intelligent assistant
that truly understands and responds to the unique needs of each user and situation.

## Appendix: Future Enhancement - Workflow Marketplace

### Overview

A Workflow Marketplace would transform the current local workflow library into a thriving ecosystem
where workflow authors can share, monetize, and collaborate on high-quality workflows. This
post-MVP enhancement would address the critical curation bottleneck while creating economic
incentives for quality contributions.
