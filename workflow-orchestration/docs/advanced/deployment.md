## Blue/Green Deployments

- Maintain two production environments (blue and green)
- Route traffic to new version only after successful validation
- Instantly rollback by switching traffic back

## Canary Releases

- Gradually roll out new versions to a subset of users
- Monitor for errors and performance regressions
- Automate promotion or rollback based on metrics

## Multi-Region Deployments

- Deploy to multiple cloud regions for high availability
- Use global load balancers (e.g., AWS Route 53, GCP Global LB)
- Sync data and workflows across regions

## Zero-Downtime Upgrades

- Use rolling updates with health checks
- Drain connections before shutting down old instances
- Automate schema migrations with backward compatibility

## Infrastructure as Code

- Use Terraform, Pulumi, or CloudFormation for all infra
- Version control all infrastructure definitions
- Automate provisioning and teardown

## Disaster Recovery Automation

- Script failover and recovery procedures
- Regularly test DR plans in staging
- Monitor RTO/RPO and document improvements

## Rollback Strategies

- Use versioned deployments and immutable artifacts
- Automate rollback on failed health checks
- Document manual rollback steps for emergencies
