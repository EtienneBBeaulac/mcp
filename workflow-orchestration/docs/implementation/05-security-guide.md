## Security Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Local-First Security**: Security measures appropriate for local deployment
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Security scales from basic to advanced as needed
3. **Fail Secure**: System fails to secure state by default
4. **Security by Design**: Security integrated from the start
5. **Simplicity**: Security should not add unnecessary complexity

### Security Goals

- **Input Validation**: Ensure all inputs are safe and valid
- **File System Security**: Protect against path traversal and unauthorized access
- **Content Security**: Prevent malicious workflow content
- **Resource Protection**: Prevent resource exhaustion attacks
- **Error Security**: Ensure error messages don't expose sensitive information

---

## Threat Model

### Attack Vectors

#### 1. **Input Validation Attacks**
- **Path Traversal**: Attempting to access system files via workflow IDs
- **Malicious Content**: Script injection in workflow content
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Large workflow files causing memory issues
- **Schema Violation**: Malformed workflow JSON causing validation errors

#### 2. **File System Attacks**
- **Directory Traversal**: Accessing files outside workflow directory
- **File Creation**: Creating malicious files in system directories
- **Permission Bypass**: Accessing files without proper permissions
- **Symbolic Link Attacks**: Following malicious symbolic links

#### 3. **Content Security Attacks**
- **Malicious Workflows**: Workflows containing dangerous commands
- **Code Injection**: Executing arbitrary code through workflow content
- **Data Leakage**: Workflows that expose sensitive information
- **Resource Abuse**: Workflows that consume excessive resources

#### 4. **Local-First Specific Attacks**
- **Workflow Poisoning**: Malicious workflows in shared directories
- **Configuration Tampering**: Modifying local configuration files
- **Log Manipulation**: Tampering with local log files
- **State Corruption**: Corrupting local workflow state files

### Risk Assessment

| Threat | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|--------|------------|
| Malicious workflow content | Medium | High | Content validation, workflow sandboxing |
| Path traversal attacks | Medium | High | Path validation, directory restrictions |
| Resource exhaustion | Low | Medium | Size limits, complexity restrictions |
| Information disclosure | Low | Medium | Secure error messages, log sanitization |

## Security Requirements

### Phase 1: Basic Security (MVP)

**Focus**: Essential security measures for local-first deployment

**Requirements**:
- **Input Validation**: Workflow ID and content validation
- **File System Security**: Path traversal protection
- **Content Security**: Malicious workflow detection
- **Resource Limits**: Size and complexity restrictions
- **Error Security**: Secure error messages

### Phase 2: Enhanced Security

**Focus**: Advanced security features for production use

**Requirements**:
- **Local Authentication**: Simple file-based authentication
- **Data Encryption**: Encryption for sensitive workflow content
- **Advanced Validation**: Enhanced input sanitization
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoint protection (if needed)
- **Audit Logging**: Security event logging

### Phase 3: Enterprise Security

**Focus**: Enterprise-grade security for advanced deployments

**Requirements**:
- **RBAC**: Role-based access control (if multi-user)
- **Security Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring
- **Incident Response**: Automated incident response
- **Compliance**: Regulatory compliance features
- **Advanced Auditing**: Comprehensive audit trails

## Implementation Strategy

### Security Integration Points

#### **MCP Server Integration**
- Security tools follow the `ToolHandler` interface
- Security validation integrates with plugin-based validation system
- Security state integrates with existing state management
- Security components work with JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol

#### **Architecture Alignment**
- Security follows established modular tool patterns
- Security validation integrates with existing ValidationEngine
- Security state integrates with workflow state management
- Security components maintain local-first approach

#### **Development Phase Integration**
- Phase 1: Basic security tools and validation
- Phase 2: Enhanced security monitoring and authentication
- Phase 3: Advanced security auditing and compliance

### Security Components

#### **Security Tools**
- `security_validate`: Core security validation for all workflow operations
- `security_monitor`: Real-time security monitoring and alerting
- `security_audit`: Comprehensive security auditing and reporting

#### **Security Validation Rules**
- Path traversal detection and prevention
- Malicious content detection and sanitization
- Resource limit enforcement
- Input validation and sanitization

#### **Security State Management**
- Local security state tracking
- Security violation recording
- Security level assessment
- Threat monitoring and alerting

## Security Guidelines

### Development Guidelines

#### **Input Validation**
- Always validate workflow IDs against schema patterns
- Sanitize all user inputs before processing
- Implement size limits for all inputs
- Use whitelist approach for file access

#### **Content Security**
- Validate workflow content for dangerous patterns
- Implement content sanitization for user inputs
- Use safe alternatives for file operations
- Implement workflow sandboxing for execution

#### **Error Handling**
- Never expose sensitive information in error messages
- Log security violations for monitoring
- Implement secure error reporting
- Use generic error messages for security failures

#### **File System Security**
- Restrict file access to safe directories
- Implement path validation for all file operations
- Use absolute paths with validation
- Implement file permission checks

### Testing Guidelines

#### **Security Testing Requirements**
- Unit tests for all security components
- Integration tests for security tool interactions
- Performance tests for security validation overhead
- Security test cases for all threat vectors

#### **Testing Coverage**
- 90%+ coverage for security components
- Comprehensive security validation testing
- Performance benchmarking for security measures
- Security regression testing

### Deployment Guidelines

#### **Local Deployment**
- Minimal security overhead for local users
- Simple file-based authentication
- Local security state management
- Basic security monitoring

#### **Production Deployment**
- Enhanced security validation
- Security monitoring and alerting
- Audit logging and compliance
- Advanced security features

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

**This is a specification project.** The security strategy described above is the planned approach for when implementation begins. Currently, no actual security measures are implemented - only the security framework design.

For implementation details, see:

- [Testing Strategy](04-testing-strategy.md) for security testing approaches
- [Development Phases](03-development-phases.md) for security implementation phases
