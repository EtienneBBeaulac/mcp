## Implementation Overview

This document provides a comprehensive implementation roadmap for the Workflow Orchestration System, aligned with the established vision and technical architecture. The roadmap follows the **hybrid orchestration pattern** where AI agents collaborate with a specialized MCP server to execute structured workflows.

### Core Vision Alignment

The implementation follows the established 3-phase approach from the [System Overview](workflow-orchestration-mcp-overview.md):

1. **Phase 1: MVP** - Basic workflowlookup MCP server with core functionality and initial workflow library
2. **Phase 2: Enhanced Features** - Workflow validation, state management, and model-aware routing hints
3. **Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities** - Non-linear execution, dynamic adaptation, and workflow marketplace

### Key Architectural Principles

Following the established design principles from the [System Overview](workflow-orchestration-mcp-overview.md):

- **Local-First**: All processing happens on the user's machine
- **Agent-Agnostic**: Works with any MCP-compatible AI agent
- **Guided, Not Forced**: Provides rails while maintaining agent autonomy
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Simple agents work, advanced agents work better
- **Transparent**: No hidden magic, just structured guidance

### Success Metrics

When implemented, we aim to achieve the metrics outlined in the [System Overview](workflow-orchestration-mcp-overview.md):
- **70%+ workflow completion rates**
- **<200ms response times**
- **Reduced hallucination in guided tasks**
- **Consistent output quality across users**
