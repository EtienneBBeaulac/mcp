## Vision & Alignment

The development roadmap for the Workflow Orchestration System is structured in three major phases, each aligned with the system's core principles:
- **Local-First**: All processing happens on the user's machine
- **Agent-Agnostic**: Works with any MCP-compatible AI agent
- **Guided, Not Forced**: Provides rails while maintaining agent autonomy
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Simple agents work, advanced agents work better
- **Transparent**: No hidden magic, just structured guidance

The roadmap is designed to deliver value incrementally, with clear milestones and measurable success criteria for each phase.

## Phase 1: MVP

**Goal:** Deliver a basic, working MCP server with core workflow orchestration functionality and an initial workflow library.

**Key Deliverables:**
- MCP server implementing the four core tools (list, get, next, validate)
- JSON-RPC 2.0 compliant API
- Workflow engine supporting step-by-step guidance
- Workflow schema validation (JSON Schema Draft 7)
- In-memory state management for workflow execution
- Initial set of example workflows

**High-Level Success Criteria:**
- Server starts and responds to core API requests
- Workflows can be listed, retrieved, and executed step-by-step
- Validation and error handling for workflows
- 70%+ workflow completion rate in guided scenarios
- <200ms response times for core operations

---

## Phase 2: Enhanced Features

**Goal:** Expand the system with advanced workflow features, improved validation, and enhanced state management.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Workflow validation enhancements (deeper schema, edge cases)
- Persistent state management (beyond in-memory)
- Model-aware routing hints for agent compatibility
- Extended workflow library with more complex scenarios
- Improved error recovery and resilience features
- Quality metrics and reporting for workflow execution

**High-Level Success Criteria:**
- Robust validation for a wide range of workflows
- Persistent state across sessions
- Model-aware guidance improves agent performance
- Error recovery mechanisms validated in testing
- Quality metrics available for workflow runs

---

## Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities

**Goal:** Enable non-linear workflow execution, dynamic adaptation, and ecosystem extensibility.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Support for non-linear and adaptive workflows
- Dynamic workflow adaptation based on agent/user feedback
- Workflow marketplace and plugin system architecture
- Multi-tenancy and scaling strategies
- Workflow versioning and upgrade support

**High-Level Success Criteria:**
- Non-linear workflows can be defined and executed
- System adapts to agent/user feedback in real time
- Plugin/marketplace system operational
- Multi-tenant deployments supported
- Versioning and upgrade paths validated

## Strategic Risks & Mitigations

- **Specification Drift:** Risk of implementation diverging from the spec. _Mitigation:_ Regular spec reviews and alignment checkpoints.
- **Over-Engineering:** Risk of building unnecessary complexity early. _Mitigation:_ Strict phase boundaries and MVP-first mindset.
- **Performance Bottlenecks:** Risk of slow response times as features grow. _Mitigation:_ Performance testing and optimization in each phase.
- **Security Gaps:** Risk of missing security requirements. _Mitigation:_ Security reviews and integration of security testing in all phases.
- **Dependency Delays:** Risk of external library or tool delays. _Mitigation:_ Early identification and fallback planning.

## Major Dependencies

- Node.js 18+ and TypeScript 5.0+
- JSON-RPC 2.0 implementation
- JSON Schema validation library
- Logging and monitoring tools
- Testing framework (e.g., Jest)
