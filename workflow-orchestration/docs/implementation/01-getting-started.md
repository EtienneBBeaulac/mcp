## Understanding the System

### The Vision

The Workflow Orchestration System aims to transform unreliable AI coding assistants into consistent, high-quality development partners through structured workflows.

**Core Problem**: LLMs are powerful but suffer from:
- Hallucination and incorrect information
- Scope creep and trying to do too much at once
- Context loss across long conversations
- Inconsistent results from the same prompts
- Missing prerequisites before implementation

**Our Solution**: Guide LLMs through proven software engineering best practices via structured, machine-readable workflows.

### Key Concepts

**The Workflow Structure:**
```json
{
  "id": "unique-identifier",
  "name": "Human-Friendly Name",
  "description": "What this workflow accomplishes",
  "preconditions": ["Prerequisites before starting"],
  "clarificationPrompts": ["Questions to resolve ambiguities"],
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "step-1",
      "title": "Step Title",
      "prompt": "Detailed instructions...",
      "requireConfirmation": true
    }
  ],
  "metaGuidance": ["Best practices that apply throughout"]
}
```

**The prep/implement/verify Pattern:**
Each implementation step follows:
- **PREP**: Understand the current state
- **IMPLEMENT**: Make focused changes
- **VERIFY**: Validate the results

### Architecture Overview

The system will consist of:
```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
│    User     │────▶│   AI Agent      │────▶│ workflowlookup│
│             │     │ (Claude, etc)   │     │  MCP Server  │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └──────────────┘
                            │                        │
                            │◀───────────────────────┘
                            │   Structured Guidance
```

## Reviewing Specifications

### Step 1: System Overview Review

Start with the comprehensive system overview:

1. **Read the Vision**: [System Overview](../workflow-orchestration-mcp-overview.md)
   - Understand the problem and solution
   - Learn about the architecture and design decisions
   - Review the user interaction model
   - Explore future directions

2. **Key Questions to Consider**:
   - Does the vision address real problems you've experienced?
   - Is the architecture approach sound?
   - Are there gaps in the current design?
   - What improvements would you suggest?

### Step 2: API Specification Analysis

Examine the MCP API specification:

1. **Review the API**: [API Specification](../spec/mcp-api-v1.0.md)
   - Four core tools: list, get, next, validate
   - JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol
   - Error handling standards
   - Request/response examples

2. **Test the Examples**:
   ```bash
   # Test the workflow_list example
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/mcp \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "jsonrpc": "2.0",
       "id": 1,
       "method": "workflow_list",
       "params": null
     }'
   ```

3. **Key Questions**:
   - Are the API endpoints sufficient?
   - Is the error handling comprehensive?
   - Are there missing features?
   - Is the protocol design sound?

### Step 3: Workflow Schema Validation

Study the workflow schema and examples:

1. **Review the Schema**: [Workflow Schema](../spec/workflow.schema.json)
   - JSON Schema Draft 7 specification
   - Validation rules and constraints
   - Required vs. optional fields

2. **Examine Examples**:
   - [Valid workflow example](../spec/examples/valid-workflow.json)
   - [Invalid workflow example](../spec/examples/invalid-workflow.json)

3. **Test Validation**:
   ```bash
   # Validate a workflow against the schema
   npm install -g ajv-cli
   ajv validate -s spec/workflow.schema.json -d spec/examples/valid-workflow.json
   ```

4. **Key Questions**:
   - Is the schema comprehensive?
   - Are there missing fields or constraints?
   - Do the examples cover edge cases?
   - Is the validation sufficient?

### Step 4: Architecture Review

Study the technical architecture:

1. **Review Architecture**: [Architecture Guide](02-architecture.md)
   - System design and components
   - Technical decisions and rationale
   - Scalability considerations

2. **Key Questions**:
   - Is the architecture sound?
   - Are there potential issues?
   - What improvements would you suggest?
   - Are there missing components?

### 2. Designing New Workflows

**Workflow Creation Process**:

1. **Identify a Need**: What development task would benefit from structured guidance?

2. **Follow the Schema**: Use the established workflow schema:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "your-workflow-id",
     "name": "Human-Friendly Name",
     "description": "Clear description of what this workflow accomplishes",
     "preconditions": ["List of prerequisites"],
     "clarificationPrompts": ["Questions to resolve ambiguities"],
     "steps": [
       {
         "id": "step-1",
         "title": "Step Title",
         "prompt": "Detailed instructions...",
         "requireConfirmation": true
       }
     ],
     "metaGuidance": ["Best practices that apply throughout"]
   }
   ```

3. **Apply Best Practices**:
   - Start with clear outcomes
   - Break down complex tasks intelligently
   - Write crystal clear prompts
   - Use preconditions wisely
   - Craft effective clarification prompts

4. **Test Your Workflow**:
   - Validate against the schema
   - Test with different scenarios
   - Get feedback from others
   - Iterate based on feedback

**Example Workflow Creation**:
```json
{
  "id": "database-migration",
  "name": "Database Migration Workflow",
  "description": "Safely migrate database schema with rollback planning",
  "preconditions": [
    "Database backup is available",
    "Migration requirements are documented",
    "Rollback strategy is planned"
  ],
  "clarificationPrompts": [
    "What is the expected downtime for this migration?",
    "Are there any data dependencies to consider?",
    "What is the rollback plan if issues occur?"
  ],
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "backup-verification",
      "title": "Verify database backup",
      "prompt": "Confirm the database backup is complete and accessible. Test restore process if possible.",
      "requireConfirmation": true
    },
    {
      "id": "migration-planning",
      "title": "Create detailed migration plan",
      "prompt": "Create a step-by-step migration plan including: SQL statements, order of operations, rollback procedures, and success criteria.",
      "requireConfirmation": true
    },
    {
      "id": "migration-execution",
      "title": "Execute migration",
      "prompt": "Execute the migration plan step by step, verifying each step before proceeding to the next.",
      "askForFiles": true
    },
    {
      "id": "verification",
      "title": "Verify migration success",
      "prompt": "Verify the migration completed successfully by checking data integrity, application functionality, and performance.",
      "requireConfirmation": true
    }
  ],
  "metaGuidance": [
    "Always have a rollback plan",
    "Test migrations in staging first",
    "Document all changes for future reference",
    "Monitor system performance after migration"
  ]
}
```
