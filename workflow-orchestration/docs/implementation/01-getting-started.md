## Understanding the System

### The Vision

The Workflow Orchestration System aims to transform unreliable AI coding assistants into consistent, high-quality development partners through structured workflows.

**Core Problem**: LLMs are powerful but suffer from:
- Hallucination and incorrect information
- Scope creep and trying to do too much at once
- Context loss across long conversations
- Inconsistent results from the same prompts
- Missing prerequisites before implementation

**Our Solution**: Guide LLMs through proven software engineering best practices via structured, machine-readable workflows.

### Key Concepts

**The Workflow Structure:**
```json
{
  "id": "unique-identifier",
  "name": "Human-Friendly Name",
  "description": "What this workflow accomplishes",
  "preconditions": ["Prerequisites before starting"],
  "clarificationPrompts": ["Questions to resolve ambiguities"],
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "step-1",
      "title": "Step Title",
      "prompt": "Detailed instructions...",
      "requireConfirmation": true
    }
  ],
  "metaGuidance": ["Best practices that apply throughout"]
}
```

**The prep/implement/verify Pattern:**
Each implementation step follows:
- **PREP**: Understand the current state
- **IMPLEMENT**: Make focused changes
- **VERIFY**: Validate the results

### Architecture Overview

The system will consist of:
```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
│    User     │────▶│   AI Agent      │────▶│ workflowlookup│
│             │     │ (Claude, etc)   │     │  MCP Server  │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └──────────────┘
                            │                        │
                            │◀───────────────────────┘
                            │   Structured Guidance
```

## Reviewing Specifications

### Step 1: System Overview Review

Start with the comprehensive system overview:

1. **Read the Vision**: [System Overview](../workflow-orchestration-mcp-overview.md)
   - Understand the problem and solution
   - Learn about the architecture and design decisions
   - Review the user interaction model
   - Explore future directions

2. **Key Questions to Consider**:
   - Does the vision address real problems you've experienced?
   - Is the architecture approach sound?
   - Are there gaps in the current design?
   - What improvements would you suggest?

### Step 2: API Specification Analysis

Examine the MCP API specification:

1. **Review the API**: [API Specification](../spec/mcp-api-v1.0.md)
   - Four core tools: list, get, next, validate
   - JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol
   - Error handling standards
   - Request/response examples

2. **Test the Examples**:
   ```bash
   # Test the workflow_list example
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/mcp \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "jsonrpc": "2.0",
       "id": 1,
       "method": "workflow_list",
       "params": null
     }'
   ```

3. **Key Questions**:
   - Are the API endpoints sufficient?
   - Is the error handling comprehensive?
   - Are there missing features?
   - Is the protocol design sound?

### Step 3: Workflow Schema Validation

Study the workflow schema and examples:

1. **Review the Schema**: [Workflow Schema](../spec/workflow.schema.json)
   - JSON Schema Draft 7 specification
   - Validation rules and constraints
   - Required vs. optional fields

2. **Examine Examples**:
   - [Valid workflow example](../spec/examples/valid-workflow.json)
   - [Invalid workflow example](../spec/examples/invalid-workflow.json)

3. **Test Validation**:
   ```bash
   # Validate a workflow against the schema
   npm install -g ajv-cli
   ajv validate -s spec/workflow.schema.json -d spec/examples/valid-workflow.json
   ```

4. **Key Questions**:
   - Is the schema comprehensive?
   - Are there missing fields or constraints?
   - Do the examples cover edge cases?
   - Is the validation sufficient?

### Step 4: Architecture Review

## Contributing to Specifications

### 1. Specification Review & Feedback

**API Specification Review**:
- **Review API completeness**: Are all necessary endpoints defined?
- **Test error handling**: Are error cases comprehensive?
- **Validate examples**: Do the curl examples work correctly?
- **Check protocol compliance**: Does it follow JSON-RPC 2.0 standards?

**Workflow Schema Review**:
- **Test edge cases**: Try invalid workflows to test validation
- **Validate constraints**: Are the schema rules appropriate?
- **Review field definitions**: Are descriptions clear and complete?
- **Check extensibility**: Can the schema accommodate future features?

**Architecture Review**:
- **Evaluate design decisions**: Are architectural choices sound?
- **Identify potential issues**: What could go wrong?
- **Suggest improvements**: What would make it better?
- **Assess scalability**: Will it handle expected load?

**Feedback Submission Process**:
1. **Create detailed issue**: Include specific problem description
2. **Provide examples**: Show the issue with concrete examples
3. **Suggest solutions**: Propose specific improvements
4. **Follow up**: Engage in discussion and iteration

### 2. Workflow Design & Creation

**Workflow Design Process**:

1. **Identify a Need**: What development task would benefit from structured guidance?
   - Common pain points in your development process
   - Tasks that often go wrong or take too long
   - Areas where you wish you had better guidance

2. **Research Existing Workflows**: Check if something similar already exists
   - Review existing workflow examples
   - Identify gaps in current coverage
   - Avoid duplicating existing work

3. **Define Clear Outcomes**: What should the user have when finished?
   - Specific, measurable results
   - Clear success criteria
   - Tangible deliverables

4. **Follow the Schema**: Use the established workflow schema with best practices

**Workflow Design Best Practices**:

**Start with Clear Outcomes**:
```json
// ❌ Bad: Vague outcome
{
  "description": "Implement feature"
}

// ✅ Good: Specific outcome
{
  "description": "Implement user authentication with email/password, including signup, login, and password reset flows"
}
```

**Break Down Complex Tasks Intelligently**:
```json
// ❌ Bad: Too large
{
  "title": "Build the entire authentication system",
  "prompt": "Implement user auth with all features"
}

// ✅ Good: Just right
{
  "title": "Create User model and database schema",
  "prompt": "Create a User model with email, hashed_password, and created_at fields. Include database migrations."
}
```

**Write Crystal Clear Prompts**:
```json
{
  "prompt": "Examine the existing UserController class in src/controllers/user_controller.rb. Identify the current authentication method (likely in the 'authenticate' method). Create a new method called 'authenticate_with_jwt' that:\n\n1. Extracts the JWT token from the Authorization header\n2. Validates the token using the existing JWT library\n3. Returns the user object if valid, raises AuthenticationError if not\n4. Includes appropriate error handling for malformed tokens\n\nMaintain the existing code style and patterns."
}
```

**Use Preconditions Wisely**:
```json
"preconditions": [
  "User has provided the authentication requirements document",
  "Database connection is configured and tested",
  "JWT secret key is available in environment variables",
  "Existing User model or specification is available"
]
```

**Craft Effective Clarification Prompts**:
```json
"clarificationPrompts": [
  "What should happen when a user tries to login with an unverified email?",
  "Should we implement rate limiting for login attempts? If so, what limits?",
  "Do you need to support social login (Google, GitHub, etc.) or just email/password?",
  "What session duration do you want? Should it be configurable?"
]
```

**Common Workflow Patterns**:

**The Investigation Step**:
```json
{
  "id": "investigate-current-state",
  "title": "Analyze existing implementation",
  "prompt": "Using grep and file reading tools, map out the current implementation. Document: entry points, existing patterns, dependencies, and any relevant utilities.",
  "requireConfirmation": true
}
```

**The Planning Step**:
```json
{
  "id": "create-implementation-plan",
  "title": "Create detailed implementation plan",
  "prompt": "Based on the investigation, create a step-by-step plan. Include: affected files, new files needed, testing approach, and migration strategy.",
  "requireConfirmation": true
}
```

**The Verification Step**:
```json
{
  "id": "verify-implementation",
  "title": "Verify implementation works correctly",
  "prompt": "Test the implementation by: 1) Creating test cases, 2) Running the functionality, 3) Verifying edge cases, 4) Checking error handling. Fix any issues found."
}
```

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid**:

**The Kitchen Sink Step**:
```json
// DON'T DO THIS
{
  "title": "Implement everything",
  "prompt": "Add authentication, authorization, user management, password reset, email verification, and admin features"
}
```

**The Vague Instruction**:
```json
// DON'T DO THIS  
{
  "prompt": "Make the authentication better"
}
```

**The Context-Free Step**:
```json
// DON'T DO THIS
{
  "prompt": "Add JWT validation",
  // Missing: where? how? what library? what error handling?
}
```

### 3. Workflow Testing & Validation

**Testing Your Workflow**:

1. **Schema Validation**:
   ```bash
   # Install validation tool
   npm install -g ajv-cli
   
   # Validate your workflow
   ajv validate -s spec/workflow.schema.json -d your-workflow.json
   ```

2. **Manual Testing**:
   - Walk through each step mentally
   - Can each step be completed with only the information provided?
   - Are there hidden dependencies between steps?
   - Do the prompts make sense in sequence?

3. **User Testing**:
   - Have someone unfamiliar with the task try your workflow
   - Where do they get confused?
   - What questions do they ask?
   - Where do they deviate from the intended path?

4. **Edge Case Testing**:
   - What if a precondition isn't actually met?
   - What if a step fails partway through?
   - Can the user recover gracefully?
   - What if the user has different skill levels?

**Workflow Quality Checklist**:

- [ ] **Clear outcome**: Specific, measurable result
- [ ] **Appropriate scope**: Not too large, not too small
- [ ] **Clear prompts**: Unambiguous instructions
- [ ] **Good preconditions**: Prevents starting without context
- [ ] **Effective clarifications**: Catches ambiguities upfront
