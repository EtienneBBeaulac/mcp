## What to Review

### Core Specifications

The workflow-orchestration system has several key specifications that need review:

1. **API Specification** (`spec/mcp-api-v1.0.md`)
   - JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol implementation
   - Five core tools: `workflow_list`, `workflow_get`, `workflow_next`, `workflow_validate`, `workflow_validate_json`
   - Error handling and response formats

2. **Workflow Schema** (`spec/workflow.schema.json`)
   - JSON Schema Draft 7 specification
   - Workflow structure and validation rules
   - Field definitions and constraints

3. **Example Workflows** (`spec/examples/`)
   - Valid workflow example (authentication)
   - Invalid workflow example (for testing)
   - Workflow design patterns

4. **Documentation** (`docs/`)
   - Architecture guide
   - Testing strategy
   - Security guide
   - Performance guide

### Review Focus Areas

**Completeness**: Are all necessary specifications present?
**Clarity**: Are the specifications easy to understand?
**Consistency**: Do specifications align with each other?
**Correctness**: Are the specifications technically sound?
**Usability**: Can someone implement from these specifications?

## Validation Process

### Step 1: Self-Review

Before submitting feedback, validate your own understanding:

1. **Read the specifications thoroughly**
2. **Try to implement a simple workflow**
3. **Test the API specification with mock requests**
4. **Validate example workflows against the schema**

### Step 2: Community Review

Engage with the community to validate your feedback:

1. **Share your findings in discussions**
2. **Get feedback from other reviewers**
3. **Refine your suggestions based on input**
4. **Submit formal feedback through issues**

### Step 3: Implementation Validation

When possible, validate specifications through implementation:

1. **Create a simple MCP server mock**
2. **Test the API with real requests**
3. **Validate workflows against the schema**
4. **Document any issues found**

### Validation Tools

**Schema Validation:**
```bash
# Validate workflow against schema
npm install ajv
node -e "
const Ajv = require('ajv');
const schema = require('./spec/workflow.schema.json');
const workflow = require('./spec/examples/valid-workflow.json');
const ajv = new Ajv();
const validate = ajv.compile(schema);
console.log('Valid:', validate(workflow));
if (!validate(workflow)) console.log('Errors:', validate.errors);
"
```

**API Testing:**
```bash
# Test API with curl
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/jsonrpc \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "workflow_list",
    "params": null
  }'
```

## Common Issues

### API Specification Issues

**Missing Error Codes:**
```json
// ‚ùå Generic error response
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": -1,
    "message": "Something went wrong"
  }
}

// ‚úÖ Specific error response
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": -32001,
    "message": "Workflow not found",
    "data": {
      "workflowId": "non-existent-workflow"
    }
  }
}
```

**Incomplete Examples:**
```json
// ‚ùå Missing required fields
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "workflows": []
  }
}

// ‚úÖ Complete example
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "workflows": [
      {
        "id": "ai-task-implementation",
        "name": "AI Task Prompt Workflow",
        "description": "Guides through task understanding ‚Üí planning ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí verification",
        "category": "development",
        "version": "1.0.0"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Schema Issues

**Missing Constraints:**
```json
// ‚ùå No length constraints
{
  "name": {
    "type": "string"
  }
}

// ‚úÖ Proper constraints
{
  "name": {
    "type": "string",
    "minLength": 1,
    "maxLength": 128
  }
}
```

**Inconsistent Patterns:**
```json
// ‚ùå Inconsistent ID patterns
{
  "id": {
    "type": "string"
  }
}

// ‚úÖ Consistent pattern
{
  "id": {
    "type": "string",
    "pattern": "^[a-z0-9-]+$",
    "minLength": 3,
    "maxLength": 64
  }
}
```

### Documentation Issues

**Vague Descriptions:**
```markdown
‚ùå "The system works with AI agents"
‚úÖ "The system provides structured guidance to MCP-compatible AI agents through JSON-RPC 2.0 API calls"
```

**Missing Examples:**
```markdown
‚ùå "Use the prep/implement/verify pattern"
‚úÖ "Use the prep/implement/verify pattern:
- **PREP**: Understand the current state
- **IMPLEMENT**: Make focused changes  
- **VERIFY**: Test and validate results"
```

## Review Examples

### Example 1: API Specification Review

**Issue Found:**
The `workflow_next` tool response doesn't clearly document the `guidance` object structure.

**Feedback:**
```
The workflow_next tool response includes a 'guidance' object, but the structure isn't fully documented. 
The response example shows:

{
  "guidance": {
    "prompt": "string",
    "modelHint": "string", 
    "requiresConfirmation": boolean,
    "validationCriteria": ["string"]
  }
}

But the field descriptions are missing. Please add:
- What 'modelHint' values are valid?
- How should 'validationCriteria' be used?
- When is 'requiresConfirmation' true vs false?
```

### Example 2: Schema Review

**Issue Found:**
The workflow schema doesn't support conditional steps or branching logic.

**Feedback:**
```
‚úÖ RESOLVED in v1.2: The workflow schema now supports conditional steps through the 
'runCondition' property. This allows workflows to implement "choose your own adventure" 
logic where steps execute based on context variables like taskScope, userExpertise, etc.

The implementation includes:
1. Optional 'runCondition' field on steps with expression-based conditions
2. Context parameter in workflow_next API for passing evaluation variables
3. Safe condition evaluation with supported operators (equals, and, or, etc.)

This enables dynamic workflows that adapt to different scenarios and user preferences.
```

### Example 3: Documentation Review

**Issue Found:**
The architecture guide doesn't explain how the prep/implement/verify pattern works in practice.

**Feedback:**
```
The architecture guide mentions the prep/implement/verify pattern but doesn't show 
how it's actually implemented. Please add:

1. A concrete example showing how a step prompt is structured
2. How the pattern helps prevent common AI issues
3. Best practices for writing effective prep/implement/verify prompts

This would help workflow authors understand how to use the pattern effectively.
```
