## Testing Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Aim for 90%+ coverage on core modules
3. **Fast Feedback**: Tests should run quickly and provide clear feedback
4. **Maintainable Tests**: Tests should be easy to understand and modify
5. **Realistic Scenarios**: Test with realistic data and scenarios
6. **Agent-Agnostic Testing**: Focus on MCP server functionality, not specific agents
7. **Guidance Quality**: Validate that guidance improves agent performance

### Testing Goals

- **Reliability**: Ensure the system works correctly under all conditions
- **Performance**: Verify performance requirements are met (<200ms response times)
- **Security**: Validate security measures are effective
- **Usability**: Confirm workflows provide value to users
- **Maintainability**: Ensure code changes don't break existing functionality
- **Agent Enhancement**: Validate that guidance reduces hallucination and improves consistency

## Testing Pyramid

Our testing strategy follows the testing pyramid approach:

```
    ┌─────────────┐
    │   E2E Tests │  ← Few, high-value tests
    └─────────────┘
    ┌─────────────┐
    │Integration  │  ← Medium number, medium scope
    │   Tests     │
    └─────────────┘
    ┌─────────────┐
    │  Unit Tests │  ← Many, focused tests
    └─────────────┘
```

### Distribution Guidelines

- **Unit Tests**: 60% of test suite (fast, focused, comprehensive)
- **Integration Tests**: 25% of test suite (medium scope, realistic scenarios)
- **E2E Tests**: 10% of test suite (critical user journeys)
- **Agent Integration Tests**: 5% of test suite (real agent validation)

## ⚠️ Important Note

**This is a specification project.** The testing strategy described above is the planned approach for when implementation begins. Currently, no actual tests exist - only the testing framework design.

- [Security Guide](05-security-guide.md) for security testing requirements
- [Development Phases](03-development-phases.md) for testing implementation phases
